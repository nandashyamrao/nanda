|--------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Model**                | Instruction Manual           | The blueprint for building the Millennium Falcon.                          | Provides structure and guidelines to assemble entities into a cohesive system.               |
| **Entity**               | LEGO Bricks                 | Individual bricks, each with a unique shape and color.                     | Represents fundamental building blocks (e.g., hosts, services, processes) in IT environments.|
| **Attribute**            | Brick Details               | Color: Grey, Size: 2x4, Type: Connector brick.                             | Adds descriptive information to entities, helping to identify and categorize them.           |
| **Metadata**             | Set Information             | "Set 75192, 7,541 pieces, 16+ years, Ultimate Collector Series."           | Provides additional context and properties for better organization and understanding.         |
| **Relationship**         | Brick Connections           | A 2x4 brick snapping onto a 1x4 brick.                                     | Defines how entities interact or depend on each other within the system.                     |
| **Metrics**              | Assembly Progress           | Tracking the number of bricks assembled per hour.                          | Measures performance, such as service response time or CPU usage, for continuous monitoring. |
| **Logs**                 | Assembly Notes              | Notes on difficult steps: “Step 12 took 5 minutes to complete.”            | Captures events and changes during the system's lifecycle for troubleshooting and analysis.  |
| **Traces**               | Build Sequence              | Steps 1 → 2 → 3: Organize pieces, connect base plates, build framework.    | Tracks the flow of data or user actions across various components for performance analysis.  |
| **Visualization**        | Final Built Structure       | The completed Millennium Falcon displayed on a shelf.                      | Presents the system’s current state in a visual format for easy understanding and decision-making.|
| **Problem**              | Missing or Misplaced Bricks | Realizing a key piece is missing during the build process.                 | Identifies issues in the system that need to be resolved to ensure optimal functionality.     |
| **Configuration**        | Brick Organization          | Sorting bricks by size and color before starting the build.                | Ensures entities are properly configured and ready for operation within the system.          |
| **Behavioral Model**     | Expected Assembly Time      | "It usually takes 10 hours to build this set."                             | Establishes normal baselines and flags deviations (e.g., a significant delay in assembly).   |
| **Semantic Model**       | Modular Sub-Models          | Building the cockpit, then the wings, then combining them.                 | Maps dependencies and relationships between entities for better system understanding.         |
| **Physical Model**       | Real-World LEGO Structure   | The tangible structure you can hold and display.                           | Represents physical components like servers and network devices.                             |
| **Logical Model**        | Sections of Instructions    | Grouping steps by segments: Cockpit, wings, engine, etc.                   | Organizes entities logically for easier management and navigation.                           |
| **AI/ML Model**          | Custom LEGO Algorithms      | Predicting which pieces will be needed next based on the current step.     | Automates tasks like anomaly detection and root cause analysis in IT systems.                |
| **Business Model**       | Collector Value Tracking    | Monitoring the resale value of the completed Millennium Falcon.            | Links IT performance to business KPIs like revenue impact and user satisfaction.             |
| **Access Control**       | Restricted Instructions     | Only the builder has access to the full manual; others see the final product. | Manages permissions and ensures security in accessing critical system data.                  |
