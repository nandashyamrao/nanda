# Integrated View: System Objects, Models, and Workflows in Dynatrace (Expanded)

Dynatrace organizes its monitoring architecture into system objects and models, which work together to enable effective workflows for monitoring, querying, and automation. This document explains their integration and application in Dynatrace workflows, with expanded details.

## Expanded Workflow Example

### **1. Discovery: Identifying Components in Your IT Environment**
- **What Happens**: 
  - Dynatrace automatically discovers all running components using agents or integrations.
  - These components are classified into **entities** like hosts, services, processes, or cloud resources.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Automation**: No manual intervention is required.
  - **Entity Mapping**: Entities are immediately categorized with metadata and tags.
- **Examples**:
  - **Host Discovery**: Dynatrace identifies `web-server-01`, collects its hostname, IP, OS type, and tags it as `region: us-east`.
  - **Service Discovery**: A new service `order-processing-service` is detected, and its deployment version and dependencies are mapped.
- **Impact of Models**:
  - **Semantic Models**: Establish relationships like "Service A calls Database B."
  - **Logical Models**: Enable grouping, such as all services in `production`.
  - **Physical Models**: Represent infrastructure, like VMs running on specific hosts.
- **Expanded Use Case**:
  - Discovery in a hybrid cloud environment identifies on-premises VMs and AWS EC2 instances, mapping dependencies between them.

### **2. Data Collection: Gathering Metrics, Logs, Traces, and Events**
- **What Happens**:
  - Dynatrace collects detailed telemetry data for each entity.
  - Data types include:
    - **Metrics**: Time-series data for CPU, memory, disk, etc.
    - **Logs**: Textual logs for debugging.
    - **Traces**: Distributed transactions spanning multiple services.
    - **Events**: Notifications of state changes or anomalies.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Real-Time Collection**: Continuous updates with minimal latency.
  - **Comprehensive Coverage**: Collects data from infrastructure, applications, and user activity.
- **Examples**:
  - A **host** provides:
    - Metrics: `CPU usage: 75%`, `Memory usage: 60%`.
    - Logs: `ERROR: Disk latency exceeded threshold`.
  - A **service** provides:
    - Metrics: `Average response time: 200ms`.
    - Events: Deployment of `v2.0.1`.
- **Impact of Models**:
  - **Semantic Models**: Correlate data (e.g., high CPU usage impacts Service A’s response time).
  - **Logical Models**: Organize data by environment (`production` vs `staging`).
  - **Physical Models**: Show where resources are hosted, like `hosted_on: AWS`.
- **Expanded Use Case**:
  - Monitoring a Kubernetes cluster collects:
    - Pod metrics, container logs, and node-level events.

### **3. Dependency Mapping: Building Relationships Between Entities**
- **What Happens**:
  - Dynatrace maps dependencies between entities, creating a comprehensive topology.
  - Relationships like `calls`, `depends_on`, and `contains` are established.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Dynamic Updates**: Reflects real-time changes in dependencies.
  - **Impact Analysis**: Understands how failures propagate.
- **Examples**:
  - A database failure impacts:
    - Service A → depends on Database B → hosted on Host C.
- **Impact of Models**:
  - **Semantic Models**: Enable root cause analysis by tracing dependencies.
  - **Logical Models**: Group related entities for easier visualization.
  - **Physical Models**: Map physical infrastructure supporting relationships.
- **Expanded Use Case**:
  - A topology shows how `Service A` relies on `Queue B`, hosted on an Azure VM.

### **4. Real-Time Monitoring: Tracking Performance and Health**
- **What Happens**:
  - Dynatrace continuously monitors the collected data, comparing it against baselines.
  - Any deviation is flagged as an anomaly.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Anomaly Detection**: Uses AI to identify unusual patterns.
  - **Baseline Creation**: Dynamically adjusts based on historical data.
- **Examples**:
  - A host's CPU usage exceeding the baseline triggers an alert.
  - A service experiencing increased response times is flagged as `Warning`.
- **Impact of Models**:
  - **Semantic Models**: Highlight affected dependencies.
  - **Logical Models**: Separate monitoring by environment or team.
  - **Physical Models**: Show hardware constraints causing the anomaly.
- **Expanded Use Case**:
  - A Kubernetes pod running out of memory is flagged, and its parent node is identified as a bottleneck.

### **5. Visualization and Querying**
- **What Happens**:
  - Data is visualized in dashboards, while DQL enables detailed queries.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Smartscape**: Real-time topology visualization.
  - **Custom Dashboards**: Monitor specific KPIs.
  - **DQL Queries**: Retrieve filtered data.
- **Examples**:
  - Smartscape shows:
    - Service A → Database B → Queue C.
  - Query:
    ```
    fetch logs
    | filter dt.entity.host == "web-server-01"
    | fields timestamp, message
    ```
- **Impact of Models**:
  - **Semantic Models**: Power Smartscape visualizations.
  - **Logical Models**: Enable grouping in dashboards.
  - **Physical Models**: Provide infrastructure context in visualizations.
- **Expanded Use Case**:
  - A custom dashboard tracks service throughput, error rates, and infrastructure health.

### **6. Alerts and Automation**
- **What Happens**:
  - Dynatrace triggers alerts and automates actions based on predefined thresholds or AI insights.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Proactive Alerts**: Notify teams before incidents escalate.
  - **Workflow Automation**: Auto-remediate issues (e.g., scaling instances).
- **Examples**:
  - An alert is sent for:
    - `Service A` exceeding response time baseline by 200ms.
  - Automation:
    - Automatically scaling a Kubernetes deployment.
- **Impact of Models**:
  - **Semantic Models**: Prioritize alerts based on dependencies.
  - **Logical Models**: Route alerts to the right team.
  - **Physical Models**: Identify resource constraints causing the alert.
- **Expanded Use Case**:
  - An alert for a critical host triggers automated failover to a backup host.
