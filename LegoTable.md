| **Model**                    | The instruction booklet for building the LEGO Millennium Falcon                                  | Provides the blueprint for organizing and constructing the final product.                                                                                     |
| **Entity**                   | Individual LEGO pieces (e.g., bricks, tiles, minifigures)                                        | Building blocks that come together to form the model.                                                                                                         |
| **Attribute**                | The color, shape, or size of a LEGO piece (e.g., 2x2 brick, red color)                           | Describes the characteristics of each LEGO piece.                                                                                                             |

| **Metric**                   | The total number of pieces or the time taken to complete the build                               | Quantifiable data that helps track progress or performance.                                                                                                   |
| **Log**                      | Notes about the building process (e.g., “Step 10: Attach the cockpit”)                          | Sequential records of events or actions taken during the build.                                                                                               |
| **Trace**                    | The sequence of steps in the instruction manual (e.g., step-by-step assembly)                   | Tracks the journey of building from start to finish.                                                                                                          |
| **Relationship**             | How pieces fit together (e.g., the cockpit piece connects to the main body)                     | Shows dependencies between LEGO pieces or subsystems to create the complete model.                                                                            |
| **Dependency**               | The need for certain pieces to be built before others (e.g., building the base before the walls) | Defines the logical order or prerequisites for constructing the model.                                                                                        |
| **Behavioral Model**         | Instructions for repeated tasks (e.g., “build 6 identical engine units”)                        | Establishes patterns or guidelines for constructing repetitive elements.                                                                                       |
| **Logical Model**            | Grouping pieces by category (e.g., all engine-related pieces in one bag)                        | Organizes components based on function or category for easier assembly.                                                                                       |
| **Physical Model**           | The physical assembly of the LEGO Millennium Falcon                                             | Represents the tangible end product after following the instructions.                                                                                          |
| **Semantic Model**           | The relationship map showing how sections of the Falcon interact (e.g., cockpit, engines)       | Explains how different parts of the LEGO model depend on and interact with each other to achieve functionality or form.                                        |
| **Configuration Model**      | Verifying that pieces match the instructions (e.g., using the correct brick color and size)     | Ensures the setup or assembly is correct and follows the guidelines provided in the instructions.                                                              |
| **Visualization**            | The picture of the finished LEGO model on the box                                              | A representation of what the final model should look like, providing a goal and reference.                                                                     |
