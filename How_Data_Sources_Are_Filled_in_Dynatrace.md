# How Data Sources Are Filled in Dynatrace

Understanding how **data sources** are filled in Dynatrace is key to grasping how the platform collects, processes, and associates data with entities. Here's a breakdown of how logs, metrics, and events—Dynatrace's primary data sources—are populated:

---

## **1. How Logs Are Collected and Populated**

### **Source of Logs**
- **Applications**: Logs are generated by applications running on monitored hosts or processes.
- **Infrastructure**: System-level logs, such as those from operating systems or middleware (e.g., Apache, NGINX).
- **Cloud Services**: Logs from cloud providers like AWS CloudWatch or Azure Monitor.

### **How Logs Are Collected**
- **Dynatrace Agents**:
  - Automatically detect and capture logs from monitored entities (e.g., hosts, processes).
  - Can be configured to ingest specific log files, such as application logs or custom logs.

- **Log Forwarding Integrations**:
  - **Cloud Log Sources**: Logs can be forwarded from cloud-native services (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure Log Analytics).
  - **Custom Log Pipelines**: Use tools like Fluentd, Logstash, or Splunk forwarders to send logs to Dynatrace.

### **Example: Logs from an Application**
1. The application writes logs to a local file.
2. The Dynatrace agent reads and parses the log file.
3. The logs are ingested and tied to the specific process, service, or host entity.

### **Key Attributes Captured**
- Timestamp
- Log level (INFO, ERROR, etc.)
- Content (log message)
- Associated entity (e.g., service or host)

## **2. How Metrics Are Collected and Populated**

### **Source of Metrics**
- **Hosts**: Metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O.
- **Processes**: Metrics like memory consumption or thread count.
- **Services**: Metrics like response times, failure rates, or throughput.
- **Custom Metrics**: User-defined metrics from third-party tools or custom scripts.
- **Cloud Metrics**: Metrics from AWS (e.g., Lambda duration), Azure, or GCP.

### **How Metrics Are Collected**
- **Dynatrace OneAgent**:
  - Automatically collects metrics from the host, processes, and services it monitors.
  - Example: CPU usage, memory consumption, network activity.

- **ActiveGate**:
  - Collects metrics from external data sources like AWS, Azure, or Kubernetes.

- **API or Push Metrics**:
  - Metrics can be pushed to Dynatrace via the **Metrics API**.
  - Example: Custom application metrics sent using scripts or integrations.

### **Example: CloudWatch Metrics**
1. Dynatrace ActiveGate integrates with AWS CloudWatch.
2. CloudWatch metrics, such as Lambda execution time or EC2 instance metrics, are ingested.
3. These metrics are mapped to the corresponding Dynatrace entities.

### **Key Attributes Captured**
- Metric name (e.g., `cpu.usage`, `response.time`)
- Value (e.g., 75% CPU usage)
- Timestamp
- Associated entity (e.g., `HOST-12345`)

## **3. How Events Are Captured and Populated**

### **Source of Events**
- **Configuration Changes**: Deployment events, scaling operations, or infrastructure changes.
- **Monitoring Alerts**: Events triggered by thresholds or anomalies detected by Dynatrace.
- **Custom Events**: User-defined events pushed via API.
- **External Sources**: Events from tools like Ansible, Jenkins, or Terraform.

### **How Events Are Collected**
- **Automatic Detection**:
  - Dynatrace detects and generates events based on changes in the environment, such as new processes, deployments, or performance degradations.
  
- **API Integrations**:
  - External tools push events to Dynatrace using the **Events API**.
  - Example: Jenkins sends a deployment event.

- **Third-Party Tools**:
  - Tools like Ansible or Terraform trigger events in Dynatrace via integrations.

### **Example: Deployment Event**
1. Jenkins deploys a new version of an application.
2. Jenkins sends an event to Dynatrace via the Events API.
3. The event is **recorded in Dynatrace** and linked to the associated service or host entity.
4. Dynatrace analyzes the event in the context of performance or stability, such as correlating it with response time or error rate spikes.

### **Key Attributes Captured**
- Event type (e.g., `DEPLOYMENT`, `ALERT`, `CONFIGURATION_CHANGE`)
- Description (e.g., "Deployed version 1.2.3")
- Timestamp
- Associated entity (e.g., `SERVICE-67890`)
- Tags or metadata (e.g., `team:backend`, `env:prod`)

## **4. How Data Sources Are Tied to Entities**

### **Automatic Association**
Dynatrace automatically associates logs, metrics, and events with entities based on:
- **Source Information:** For example, a log file captured by a host agent is linked to the host entity.
- **Metadata and Tags:** Custom or system-defined metadata helps associate data with entities.
- **Topology Mapping:** Dynatrace Smartscape topology maps dependencies between entities, further enriching data associations.

### **Unified Data View**
Once the data sources are ingested and tied to entities:
- **Logs:** Show operational details tied to specific entities like hosts or services.
- **Metrics:** Provide performance data for the same entities.
- **Events:** Capture state changes or incidents affecting the entities.

---

## **5. Examples of Data Flow**

### **Example 1: Logs from an Application**
1. A Java application running on `host-1` generates logs in `/var/logs/app.log`.
2. The Dynatrace OneAgent installed on `host-1`:
   - Reads the log file.
   - Parses the logs.
   - Associates the logs with the `order-service` entity running on `host-1`.
3. The logs become searchable in Dynatrace, tied to `order-service`.

### **Example 2: Metrics from AWS Lambda**
1. AWS CloudWatch collects metrics for a Lambda function, such as execution time.
2. Dynatrace ActiveGate:
   - Connects to AWS CloudWatch.
   - Fetches the metrics.
   - Links the metrics to the corresponding Lambda function entity in Dynatrace.
3. The metrics appear in Dynatrace under the Lambda function's metrics dashboard.

### **Example 3: Deployment Event**
1. A Jenkins pipeline deploys a new version of `payment-service`.
2. Jenkins sends an event to Dynatrace using the Events API.
3. Dynatrace links the event to the `payment-service` entity and visualizes it in the context of service health.

## **6. Customizing Data Sources**

### **Custom Logs**
- You can configure the OneAgent to monitor specific log files.
- Example:
  - Add a custom log path to the OneAgent configuration.
  - Dynatrace ingests and associates the logs with the appropriate host or service.

### **Custom Metrics**
- Push metrics via the Dynatrace Metrics API.
- Example:
  - Send application-specific metrics like "active_users" or "queue_length."
  - Metrics are linked to the corresponding service or host.

### **Custom Events**
- Use the Dynatrace Events API to send custom events.
- Example:
  - Push a `CONFIGURATION_CHANGE` event when updating a database configuration.
  - Associate the event with the relevant database entity.

## **7. Summary: Filling Data Sources**

| **Data Source** | **How It's Filled**                                                                 | **Examples**                                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Logs**         | Ingested from monitored entities via OneAgent, log forwarding, or APIs.            | Application logs, system logs.                |
| **Metrics**      | Automatically collected by OneAgent or ActiveGate, or pushed via API.              | CPU usage, response time, custom metrics.     |
