# Log Hygiene & Parsing Validation Checklist for Dynatrace OpenPipeline (Updated 2025-04-08)

This checklist helps developers, SREs, and platform engineers ensure their application logs are clean, parsable, and usable by Dynatrace‚Äôs AI and analytics systems. Following these practices improves Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR), enhances the accuracy of Davis AI problem detection, helps manage log ingestion costs, and strengthens security posture through better visibility and masking.

## ‚úÖ Log Formatting & Structure

- [ ] Logs follow a **consistent and predictable format** across all services (e.g., JSON, key-value pairs).
- [ ] Log format is **structured** (preferably JSON) or follows a documented, easily parsable pattern.
- [ ] Each log line includes a **parseable timestamp** (`ISO8601`, RFC3339, or `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS`).
- [ ] Each log line includes a **log level** or can have one inferred (`INFO`, `ERROR`, etc.).
- [ ] Multi-line logs (e.g., stack traces) are properly handled (e.g., merged by the agent/shipper or clearly delimited).
- [ ] Fields use consistent naming conventions (`request_id`, `trace_id`, `user_id`, `service.name`, etc.).
- [ ] All logs include a **clear, human-readable message field** summarizing the event without excessive verbosity.
- [ ] Timestamps are **in UTC** to avoid time zone confusion across distributed systems.
- [ ] Appropriate log levels are used in production to avoid **excessive logging** (noise) and manage volume/cost.

---

## ‚úÖ Severity Classification (logLevel)

- [ ] Known log levels are used: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`.
- [ ] **Severity levels are used appropriately** (e.g., `ERROR` for actual errors needing attention, `WARN` for potential issues or recoverable errors, `INFO` for routine operations, `DEBUG`/`TRACE` for detailed diagnostics usually disabled in production).
- [ ] The chosen severity level accurately reflects the **potential impact or urgency** of the logged event.
- [ ] Consistency in severity usage is maintained across services to enable **reliable filtering and alerting**.
- [ ] No important logs are assigned `logLevel: NONE` due to parsing issues.
- [ ] Custom log levels (e.g., `CRIT`, `MAJOR`) are **remapped** to standard levels using Dynatrace processing rules for consistent handling.
- [ ] Log level is correctly extracted using parsing rules or `FIELDS_REMAP`.
- [ ] Severity text and number are properly set for OpenTelemetry logs according to specification.

---

## ‚úÖ Enrichment & Context

- [ ] Logs contain key **contextual identifiers**: `environment`, `team`, `region`, `host.name`, `k8s.pod.name`, etc.
- [ ] Explicit **application or service name** (`service.name`) is consistently included.
- [ ] Relevant cloud/Kubernetes metadata (namespace, node, deployment name, etc.) is captured or added (often automatic via OneAgent/OTel).
- [ ] Relevant business or application metadata is added using `FIELDS_ADD`, `FIELDS_RENAME`, or `FIELDS_COPY`.
- [ ] Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens, PII) is **removed or masked** *before* ingestion or using `FIELDS_MASK`.
- [ ] Trace (`trace_id`) and Span (`span_id`) IDs are included for correlation with distributed traces.

---

## üß™ Testing & Validation

- [ ] Log format changes are **tested** in a non-production environment before rollout.
- [ ] Dynatrace parsing/processing rules are **validated against sample log lines** before applying globally.
- [ ] Tested key **DQL queries** against ingested logs to confirm fields (e.g., `logLevel`, `service.name`, custom attributes) are extracted as expected.

---

## ‚úÖ Dynatrace Ingestion-Specific (OpenPipeline)

- [ ] Parsing rules are applied correctly in **Log Processing** (custom or built-in rules).
- [ ] Key fields (`logLevel`, `timestamp`, `content`, `service.name`, custom attributes) are extracted accurately.
- [ ] OpenPipeline steps (e.g., parse ‚Üí enrich ‚Üí transform ‚Üí mask ‚Üí route) are validated end-to-end.
- [ ] Routing rules correctly associate logs with the intended entities (hosts, services, k8s workloads).
- [ ] Performance impact of complex parsing rules is considered, especially for high-volume logs.

---

## ‚úÖ Queryability with DQL

- [ ] Key fields like `logLevel`, `service.name`, `status_code`, `env` are consistently available for filtering and aggregation in DQL.
- [ ] You can run basic aggregation queries like:
  ```dql
  fetch logs | summarize count() by logLevel, service.name

and get meaningful, well-distributed results.
 * [ ] Filtering on specific levels or attributes (e.g., logLevel == "ERROR" and k8s.namespace == "production") returns the expected logs.
 * [ ] Logs can be effectively filtered or visualized in Dynatrace dashboards using standard and custom fields.
‚úÖ Monitoring & Problem Integration
 * [ ] Davis AI can leverage the structured log data and accurate severity levels to enrich root cause analysis for problems.
 * [ ] You can seamlessly correlate logs with related metrics and traces within Dynatrace.
 * [ ] Important error or warning logs are not missed by monitoring due to missing, misparsed, or incorrectly routed data.
‚úÖ Maintenance & Governance
 * [ ] Log format standards are documented and accessible to development teams.
 * [ ] Log format changes are versioned or communicated clearly.
 * [ ] Dynatrace processing rules are reviewed periodically (e.g., quarterly) for effectiveness, accuracy, and necessity.
 * [ ] logLevel: NONE rate is tracked and addressed by fixing upstream formatting or improving parsing rules.
 * [ ] A process exists for deprecating or removing log formats/sources and associated processing rules when no longer needed.
 * [ ] Documentation links internal logging standards to the relevant Dynatrace configuration (e.g., processing rules).
 * [ ] Ingestion volume and cost are monitored; unused or low-value logs are identified and potentially filtered out earlier.
Sample DQL for Unparsed Log Inspection
// Identify logs potentially needing better parsing rules
fetch logs
| filter logLevel == "NONE"
| summarize count(), earliest(timestamp), latest(timestamp) by log.source, dt.entity.host, dt.process.name
| sort count() desc

Final Tip
> Good logs aren't just for debugging. They are critical telemetry assets for AI-driven operations, security insight, compliance tracking, cost management, and understanding user journeys. Treat them with care throughout their lifecycle, ensuring content, structure, and severity are accurate and consistent.

## üîÑ How Dynatrace OpenPipeline Handles `severity_number` Better

| Feature                             | Benefit                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FIELDS_REMAP()`                    | Map `severity_number` to standard `logLevel` during ingestion.         |
| Fallback logic                      | Derive `logLevel` from number if `severity_text` is missing.           |
| Conditional routing                 | Route logs differently based on numeric severity.                      |
| Normalization at scale              | Enforce uniform log levels across mixed sources (OTel, Fluent Bit, etc.)|
| Traceability                        | Combine severity with `trace_id`, `span_id`, and service context.      |

### üõ†Ô∏è Example Mapping Rule:

```dql
FIELDS_REMAP(logLevel, {
  "^([1-4])$": "TRACE",
  "^([5-8])$": "DEBUG",
  "^([9-12])$": "INFO",
  "^([13-16])$": "WARN",
  "^([17-20])$": "ERROR",
  "^([21-24])$": "FATAL"
}, fallback="INFO")
```

---

## üß© Enrichment & Context

- ‚úÖ Include contextual IDs: `environment`, `team`, `region`, `k8s.pod.name`, `host.name`.
- ‚úÖ Include `service.name` explicitly.
- ‚úÖ Add metadata using `FIELDS_ADD`, `FIELDS_COPY`.
- ‚úÖ Mask sensitive data using `FIELDS_MASK`.
- ‚úÖ Add `trace_id` and `span_id` for trace correlation.

---

## üîç Testing & Validation

- ‚úÖ Test format changes in staging first.
- ‚úÖ Use the **Dynatrace Log Viewer** to inspect parsed fields.
- ‚úÖ Validate with DQL:
  ```dql
  fetch logs
  | filter logLevel == "ERROR"
  | summarize count() by service.name
  ```

---

## üîÅ Dynatrace OpenPipeline Processing

- ‚úÖ Ensure logs pass through all stages:
  - **Parse** ‚Üí **Enrich** ‚Üí **Transform** ‚Üí **Mask** ‚Üí **Route**
- ‚úÖ Use `FIELDS_REMAP`, `FIELDS_RENAME`, `FIELDS_ADD`, and `FIELDS_MASK` strategically.
- ‚úÖ Routing rules associate logs with proper services/entities.
- ‚úÖ Validate OpenPipeline rules using test log samples.

---

## üìä Querying & Dashboarding

- ‚úÖ Fields like `logLevel`, `service.name`, `env` are visible in DQL.
- ‚úÖ Dashboards can break down logs by severity and source.
- ‚úÖ Problem cards use logs effectively when severity is parsed.
- ‚úÖ DQL sample:
  ```dql
  fetch logs
  | summarize count() by logLevel, service.name
  ```

---

## üß† Davis AI & Problem Detection

- ‚úÖ Davis can use logs with `logLevel` to identify or enrich issues.
- ‚úÖ Proper severity detection improves root cause analysis.
- ‚úÖ Logs correlate with traces and metrics on the same dashboard.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Governance & Maintenance

- ‚úÖ Standards are documented and visible to developers.
- ‚úÖ Rules are versioned and reviewed quarterly.
- ‚úÖ `logLevel: NONE` rate is monitored and reduced.
- ‚úÖ Ingestion volume and noise are regularly evaluated.

---

## üß™ DQL for Unparsed Logs

```dql
fetch logs
| filter logLevel == "NONE"
| summarize count(), earliest(timestamp), latest(timestamp) by log.source, dt.entity.host, dt.process.name
| sort count() desc
```

# üìò Log Format Types & Parsing Examples for Dynatrace OpenPipeline

This guide compares common log formats and provides examples of how to parse them using Dynatrace OpenPipeline's `PARSE()` function or preprocessing tools.

---

## 1. üü¢ JSON Format (Recommended)

### Example Log:
```json
{ "timestamp": "2024-04-08T12:00:00Z", "logLevel": "INFO", "message": "Service started", "service": "auth-service" }
```

### Parsing:
Dynatrace auto-detects JSON and extracts fields. No custom parsing usually needed.

---

## 2. üîµ Key-Value Format

### Example Log:
```
timestamp=2024-04-08 level=ERROR msg="Failed login" user=abc123
```

### Parsing Rule:
```dql
PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp level:logLevel msg:content user")
```

---

## 3. üü° Line-Based Log (Simple Pattern)

### Example Log:
```
2024-04-08 12:00:00 ERROR [auth-service] Failed login attempt
```

### Parsing Rule:
```dql
PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp logLevel:logLevel [service] content")
```

---

## 4. üü£ Apache/Nginx Access Logs

### Example Log:
```
127.0.0.1 - - [08/Apr/2024:12:00:00 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1024
```

### Parsing Rule:
```dql
PARSE(content, "ip - - [timestamp] \\"method url protocol\\" status bytes")
```

---

## 5. üß° Syslog

### Example Log:
```
<34>1 2024-04-08T12:00:00Z hostname appname 1234 - - Login failed
```

### Parsing Rule:
```dql
PARSE(content, "<priority>version timestamp host app pid - - content")
```

---

## 6. üî∂ Delimited Format (CSV)

### Example Log:
```
2024-04-08, ERROR, Failed login, auth-service
```

### Parsing Rule:
```dql
PARSECSV(content, ["timestamp", "logLevel", "content", "service"])
```

---

## 7. üî¥ Log4j Pattern Layout

### Log Pattern:
```
%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5p [%c] - %m%n
```

### Example Log:
```
2024-04-08 12:00:00 ERROR [auth-service] - Login failed
```

### Parsing Rule:
```dql
PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp logLevel:logLevel [service] - content")
```

---

## 8. ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiline Logs (e.g., Java stack traces)

- Must be merged **before ingestion** using tools like Fluent Bit or Cribl.
- Each stack trace should be captured as one log event.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendation

| Format    | Recommended | Why                          |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| JSON      | ‚úÖ Best      | Fully structured, rich fields |
| Key-Value | ‚úÖ Good      | Simple and clean              |
| Line/Text | ‚ö†Ô∏è Okay      | Requires custom rules         |
| Multiline | ‚ùå Avoid     | Needs merging logic           |

---

Would you like DQL templates for dashboards or anomaly detection rules next?
'''
Excellent question!

In the context of log ingestion and processing (especially for tools like Dynatrace OpenPipeline, Fluent Bit, Cribl, or OpenTelemetry), log formats define how the log data is structured or written before being parsed and processed.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Common Log Format Types

Format Type	Description	Example
JSON	Structured, machine-readable format. Most modern apps prefer this.	{ "timestamp": "...", "logLevel": "INFO", "message": "Started app" }
Key-Value (KV)	Flat format with keys and values separated by = or :	timestamp=2024-04-08 level=ERROR msg="Failed login"
Delimited (CSV/TSV)	Values separated by commas or tabs. Must rely on order or header row.	2024-04-08, ERROR, Failed login
Line-based Text	Human-readable text with embedded timestamp/severity. Most legacy systems use this.	2024-04-08 12:00:00 ERROR Failed login attempt
Syslog	Standardized log format used by Unix/Linux systems and network devices	<34>1 2024-04-08T12:00:00Z hostname appname 1234 - - Login failed
Log4j/Logback Pattern Layout	Log lines follow a custom string pattern defined in Java logging frameworks	%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5p [%c] - %m%n
Apache/Nginx Access Logs	Predefined formats used in web server access logs	127.0.0.1 - - [08/Apr/2024:12:00:00 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1024
Multiline (Stack Trace)	Logs that span multiple lines ‚Äî common with Java/Python errors	First line: Exception..., Next lines: indented stack frames



‚∏ª

üß† How Dynatrace OpenPipeline Handles These

Format Type	Parsing Support	Notes
JSON	‚úÖ Automatic detection	
KV	‚úÖ Via parsing rules (key=value)	
Line-based	‚úÖ With PARSE() using regex or structure	
Multiline	‚ö†Ô∏è Needs pre-processing (Fluent Bit, Cribl) or merging	
Syslog	‚úÖ Through integration or Fluent Bit	
Apache/Nginx	‚úÖ Custom PARSE() or Fluent Bit/Nginx plugin	
CSV	‚úÖ Via Cribl/OpenTelemetry Collector ‚Üí JSON	
Log4j Layout	‚úÖ With custom regex-based PARSE() rules	



‚∏ª

‚úÖ Best Practices
	‚Ä¢	Prefer JSON wherever possible ‚Äî it‚Äôs easily parsable and rich in context.
	‚Ä¢	Avoid multiline logs unless your collector merges them properly.
	‚Ä¢	If using custom patterns (like Log4j), document them and build robust PARSE() rules.
	‚Ä¢	Use a log shipper (e.g., Fluent Bit or Cribl) to normalize formats before reaching OpenPipeline.

## ‚úÖ Additional Log Formats & Rules per Technology

| Technology / Stack         | Likely Log Format          | Parsing Consideration                                               | Rule Suggestion Example |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Java (Spring, Log4j)**   | Pattern layout / multiline | Example: `%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5p [%c] - %m%n`                 | `PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp logLevel:logLevel [logger] - content")` |
| **Python (Django, Flask)** | Line-based with timestamp  | Example: `2024-04-08 12:00:00,123 ERROR root: Something failed`     | `PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp logLevel:logLevel logger:content")` |
| **Go**                     | JSON or flat structured    | Example: `time="..." level="error" msg="..."`                       | `PARSE(content, "time:timestamp level:logLevel msg:content")` |
| **Node.js**                | JSON (often custom)        | JSON.stringify or Winston logger format                             | JSON auto-detect; enrich if needed |
| **.NET Core / ASP.NET**    | JSON (Serilog / MS schema) | Ensure field normalization: `level ‚Üí logLevel`                      | Auto-detect + `FIELDS_RENAME(level, logLevel)` |
| **Scala / Akka / Spark**   | Pattern layout             | Example: `%d %-5p %c{1}: %m%n`                                       | `PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp logLevel:logLevel logger:content")` |
| **Apache / Nginx**         | Access log format          | Example: `127.0.0.1 - - [timestamp] "METHOD URI PROTOCOL" status`   | `PARSE(content, "ip - - [timestamp] \\"method url protocol\\" status bytes")` |
| **MongoDB / MySQL / PGSQL**| Syslog or DB event logs    | Format: `timestamp severity [module] message`                       | `PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp severity:logLevel module:content")` |
| **RabbitMQ / MQ Brokers**  | Line logs or JSON events   | Format: `timestamp type=ERROR msg="..."`                            | `PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp type:logLevel msg:content")` |
| **AWS Lambda / CloudWatch**| Embedded JSON              | Logs wrapped in CloudWatch wrappers, may require flattening         | Use pre-merge + JSON parsing |
| **Cribl / Fluent Bit**     | JSON + OTEL fields         | May include `severity_number`, `body`, etc.                         | Use `FIELDS_REMAP(logLevel, {...})` |
| **React / Angular**        | Console logs, JS errors    | Not structured ‚Äî often stack trace or printf-style                  | Best pre-processed at source or via browser collector |

## ‚úÖ Summary & Best Practices

- Prioritize **JSON** or **consistent pattern-based logs**.
- Normalize `logLevel` field for AI and DQL filtering.
- Handle **multiline** and **severity_number** using upstream processors.
- Document and test parsing rules per service or language.

---
Here‚Äôs a detailed explanation of each row from your table to help you better understand log format types, parsing strategies, and how Dynatrace OpenPipeline handles them:

‚∏ª

1. Java (Spring / Log4j)
	‚Ä¢	Format Type: Pattern Layout
	‚Ä¢	Parser Type: PARSE()
	‚Ä¢	Parsing Notes:
	‚Ä¢	Java applications using Log4j or Logback often format logs using custom patterns like:

%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5p [%c] - %m%n


	‚Ä¢	You need to build a PARSE() rule to extract fields such as timestamp, log level, logger class, and the message.
	‚Ä¢	Example Rule:

PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp logLevel:logLevel [logger] - content")



‚∏ª

2. Python (Django / Flask)
	‚Ä¢	Format Type: Line-Based (unstructured)
	‚Ä¢	Parser Type: PARSE()
	‚Ä¢	Parsing Notes:
	‚Ä¢	Python apps log in formats like:

2024-04-08 12:00:00,123 ERROR root: Something failed


	‚Ä¢	This needs parsing of timestamp, severity, and logger name.
	‚Ä¢	Example Rule:

PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp logLevel:logLevel logger:content")



‚∏ª

3. Go
	‚Ä¢	Format Type: JSON or Structured Flat
	‚Ä¢	Parser Type: JSON auto-detect or PARSE()
	‚Ä¢	Parsing Notes:
	‚Ä¢	Go apps often use structured logging:

{ "time": "2024-04-08T12:00:00Z", "level": "error", "msg": "User failed login" }


	‚Ä¢	Dynatrace can auto-detect JSON, but you may want to remap fields:

FIELDS_RENAME(level, logLevel)



‚∏ª

4. .NET Core / ASP.NET
	‚Ä¢	Format Type: JSON
	‚Ä¢	Parser Type: Auto-detect
	‚Ä¢	Parsing Notes:
	‚Ä¢	.NET uses Serilog or Microsoft.Extensions.Logging, which emit JSON like:

{ "Timestamp": "...", "Level": "Error", "Message": "..." }


	‚Ä¢	Normalize keys to match Dynatrace expectations:

FIELDS_RENAME(Level, logLevel)



‚∏ª

5. Apache / Nginx Access Logs
	‚Ä¢	Format Type: Access Log
	‚Ä¢	Parser Type: Regex or PARSE()
	‚Ä¢	Parsing Notes:
	‚Ä¢	Logs are formatted like:

127.0.0.1 - - [08/Apr/2024:12:00:00 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1024


	‚Ä¢	You must use quotes and brackets to delimit values.
	‚Ä¢	Example Rule:

PARSE(content, "ip - - [timestamp] \\\"method url protocol\\\" status bytes")



‚∏ª

6. MongoDB / PostgreSQL / MySQL
	‚Ä¢	Format Type: Syslog-style or Line-Based
	‚Ä¢	Parser Type: Line parse
	‚Ä¢	Parsing Notes:
	‚Ä¢	Example log:

2024-04-08 12:00:00 ERROR [replset] connection refused


	‚Ä¢	Parse timestamp, severity, and text using basic rules:

PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp logLevel:logLevel [module] content")



‚∏ª

7. Fluent Bit
	‚Ä¢	Format Type: JSON
	‚Ä¢	Parser Type: Auto-detect
	‚Ä¢	Parsing Notes:
	‚Ä¢	Fluent Bit often emits logs in JSON format, possibly with Kubernetes metadata.
	‚Ä¢	No need for parsing ‚Äî but field renaming and enrichment may be useful:

FIELDS_RENAME(level, logLevel)



‚∏ª

8. Lambda / AWS Logs (CloudWatch)
	‚Ä¢	Format Type: JSON or Embedded in Wrappers
	‚Ä¢	Parser Type: Pre-merge + PARSE()
	‚Ä¢	Parsing Notes:
	‚Ä¢	Logs might look like:

START RequestId...
{"timestamp":"...","message":"..."}
END RequestId...


	‚Ä¢	You must merge multiline logs first (using Fluent Bit or Cribl), then apply parsing to the embedded JSON:

PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp message:content")

# üìò Log Format Types Explained by Technology Stack

This document explains various log format types associated with your tech stack and how to parse them efficiently using Dynatrace OpenPipeline.

## üìä Table of Log Format Strategies

| Technology / Stack         | Format Type             | Parser Type       | Parsing Notes |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| **Java (Spring / Log4j)**   | Pattern Layout            | `PARSE()`          | Uses patterns like `%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5p [%c] - %m%n`. Requires extraction of timestamp, logLevel, logger, and message using `PARSE()`. |
| **Python (Django / Flask)** | Line-based                | `PARSE()`          | Example log: `2024-04-08 12:00:00,123 ERROR root: Something failed`. Parse timestamp, logLevel, logger, and content. |
| **Go**                      | JSON or flat structured   | JSON / `PARSE()`   | Uses logs like `time="..." level="error" msg="..."`. JSON auto-detect works, or remap fields like `level ‚Üí logLevel`. |
| **.NET Core / ASP.NET**     | JSON                      | Auto-detect        | Emits Serilog/Microsoft JSON logs. Normalize field names using `FIELDS_RENAME(Level, logLevel)`. |
| **Apache / Nginx**          | Access Log                | Regex / `PARSE()`  | Logs like `127.0.0.1 - - [timestamp] "METHOD URI PROTOCOL" status`. Use brackets and quotes in parsing. |
| **Mongo / PostgreSQL / MySQL** | Syslog or DB event logs | Line parse         | Logs contain timestamp, severity, and module. Parse with `PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp logLevel:logLevel [module] content")`. |
| **Fluent Bit**              | JSON                      | Auto-detect        | Fluent Bit sends structured logs. No parsing required, but fields may need enriching/renaming. |
| **Lambda / AWS Logs**       | JSON or embedded format   | Merge + `PARSE()`  | CloudWatch logs are embedded or multiline. Use Fluent Bit or Cribl to merge, then extract JSON content. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Parsing Rules

### Java Pattern
```dql
PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp logLevel:logLevel [logger] - content")
```

### Python Log Line
```dql
PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp logLevel:logLevel logger:content")
```

### Go Log Line
```dql
PARSE(content, "time:timestamp level:logLevel msg:content")
```

### Apache Access Log
```dql
PARSE(content, "ip - - [timestamp] \\\"method url protocol\\\" status bytes")
```

### MongoDB / Postgres
```dql
PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp severity:logLevel module:content")
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Prefer **structured JSON** formats where possible.
- Normalize log levels for consistency using `FIELDS_REMAP()` or `FIELDS_RENAME()`.
- Pre-process multiline logs before sending them to Dynatrace.
- Validate parsing rules in staging environments before production rollout.

# üü° Potential Enhancements (Optional or Niche)

These technologies and use cases are either niche, emerging, or require special handling before being fully parsed and ingested by Dynatrace OpenPipeline.

---

- **Edge Devices / IoT (MQTT, SNMP)**  
  May require structured key-value parsing. Some messages may need to be pre-processed for timestamp or log level extraction.

- **gRPC / RSocket**  
  These protocols often transmit messages in base64 or binary. Log payloads may need to be decoded or structured before parsing.

- **Legacy Windows (Event Viewer, Perfmon)**  
  Logs need to be exported (e.g., via Windows Event Forwarder) and transformed into JSON or key-value format before ingestion.

- **Security Logging (Vault, SAML, OAuth)**  
  Must ensure that sensitive fields like tokens, secrets, and credentials are redacted or masked using `FIELDS_MASK`.

- **Front-End Logging (React, Angular)**  
  JavaScript errors and logs should be captured using `console.error`, `window.onerror`, or a browser collector. Often sent to an endpoint in JSON format.

- **CI/CD Tools (Jenkins, GitLab)**  
  Build and deploy logs are typically line-based. Ensure timestamps and log levels are parsed using `PARSE()` rules.

- **Cloud Service Logs (CloudTrail, Azure Monitor)**  
  Logs are deeply nested JSON and may include metadata. Use flattening (via Cribl, Lambda, or Fluent Bit) before applying parsing rules.

- **Kubernetes / OpenShift**  
  Container stdout/stderr logs are automatically captured by Fluent Bit or OTEL sidecars. Enrichment with pod metadata is recommended.

‚úÖ **Tip:**  
If you use any of these, create custom parsing rules, pre-process logs where needed, and test in staging before applying globally.
