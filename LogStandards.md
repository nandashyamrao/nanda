# Log Hygiene & Parsing Validation Checklist for Dynatrace OpenPipeline (Updated 2025-04-08)

This checklist helps developers, SREs, and platform engineers ensure their application logs are clean, parsable, and usable by Dynatrace‚Äôs AI and analytics systems. Following these practices improves Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR), enhances the accuracy of Davis AI problem detection, helps manage log ingestion costs, and strengthens security posture through better visibility and masking.

## ‚úÖ Log Formatting & Structure

- [ ] Logs follow a **consistent and predictable format** across all services (e.g., JSON, key-value pairs).
- [ ] Log format is **structured** (preferably JSON) or follows a documented, easily parsable pattern.
- [ ] Each log line includes a **parseable timestamp** (`ISO8601`, RFC3339, or `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS`).
- [ ] Each log line includes a **log level** or can have one inferred (`INFO`, `ERROR`, etc.).
- [ ] Multi-line logs (e.g., stack traces) are properly handled (e.g., merged by the agent/shipper or clearly delimited).
- [ ] Fields use consistent naming conventions (`request_id`, `trace_id`, `user_id`, `service.name`, etc.).
- [ ] All logs include a **clear, human-readable message field** summarizing the event without excessive verbosity.
- [ ] Timestamps are **in UTC** to avoid time zone confusion across distributed systems.
- [ ] Appropriate log levels are used in production to avoid **excessive logging** (noise) and manage volume/cost.

---

## ‚úÖ Severity Classification (logLevel)

- [ ] Known log levels are used: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`.
- [ ] **Severity levels are used appropriately** (e.g., `ERROR` for actual errors needing attention, `WARN` for potential issues or recoverable errors, `INFO` for routine operations, `DEBUG`/`TRACE` for detailed diagnostics usually disabled in production).
- [ ] The chosen severity level accurately reflects the **potential impact or urgency** of the logged event.
- [ ] Consistency in severity usage is maintained across services to enable **reliable filtering and alerting**.
- [ ] No important logs are assigned `logLevel: NONE` due to parsing issues.
- [ ] Custom log levels (e.g., `CRIT`, `MAJOR`) are **remapped** to standard levels using Dynatrace processing rules for consistent handling.
- [ ] Log level is correctly extracted using parsing rules or `FIELDS_REMAP`.
- [ ] Severity text and number are properly set for OpenTelemetry logs according to specification.

---

## ‚úÖ Enrichment & Context

- [ ] Logs contain key **contextual identifiers**: `environment`, `team`, `region`, `host.name`, `k8s.pod.name`, etc.
- [ ] Explicit **application or service name** (`service.name`) is consistently included.
- [ ] Relevant cloud/Kubernetes metadata (namespace, node, deployment name, etc.) is captured or added (often automatic via OneAgent/OTel).
- [ ] Relevant business or application metadata is added using `FIELDS_ADD`, `FIELDS_RENAME`, or `FIELDS_COPY`.
- [ ] Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens, PII) is **removed or masked** *before* ingestion or using `FIELDS_MASK`.
- [ ] Trace (`trace_id`) and Span (`span_id`) IDs are included for correlation with distributed traces.

---

## üß™ Testing & Validation

- [ ] Log format changes are **tested** in a non-production environment before rollout.
- [ ] Dynatrace parsing/processing rules are **validated against sample log lines** before applying globally.
- [ ] Tested key **DQL queries** against ingested logs to confirm fields (e.g., `logLevel`, `service.name`, custom attributes) are extracted as expected.

---

## ‚úÖ Dynatrace Ingestion-Specific (OpenPipeline)

- [ ] Parsing rules are applied correctly in **Log Processing** (custom or built-in rules).
- [ ] Key fields (`logLevel`, `timestamp`, `content`, `service.name`, custom attributes) are extracted accurately.
- [ ] OpenPipeline steps (e.g., parse ‚Üí enrich ‚Üí transform ‚Üí mask ‚Üí route) are validated end-to-end.
- [ ] Routing rules correctly associate logs with the intended entities (hosts, services, k8s workloads).
- [ ] Performance impact of complex parsing rules is considered, especially for high-volume logs.

---

## ‚úÖ Queryability with DQL

- [ ] Key fields like `logLevel`, `service.name`, `status_code`, `env` are consistently available for filtering and aggregation in DQL.
- [ ] You can run basic aggregation queries like:
  ```dql
  fetch logs | summarize count() by logLevel, service.name

and get meaningful, well-distributed results.
 * [ ] Filtering on specific levels or attributes (e.g., logLevel == "ERROR" and k8s.namespace == "production") returns the expected logs.
 * [ ] Logs can be effectively filtered or visualized in Dynatrace dashboards using standard and custom fields.
‚úÖ Monitoring & Problem Integration
 * [ ] Davis AI can leverage the structured log data and accurate severity levels to enrich root cause analysis for problems.
 * [ ] You can seamlessly correlate logs with related metrics and traces within Dynatrace.
 * [ ] Important error or warning logs are not missed by monitoring due to missing, misparsed, or incorrectly routed data.
‚úÖ Maintenance & Governance
 * [ ] Log format standards are documented and accessible to development teams.
 * [ ] Log format changes are versioned or communicated clearly.
 * [ ] Dynatrace processing rules are reviewed periodically (e.g., quarterly) for effectiveness, accuracy, and necessity.
 * [ ] logLevel: NONE rate is tracked and addressed by fixing upstream formatting or improving parsing rules.
 * [ ] A process exists for deprecating or removing log formats/sources and associated processing rules when no longer needed.
 * [ ] Documentation links internal logging standards to the relevant Dynatrace configuration (e.g., processing rules).
 * [ ] Ingestion volume and cost are monitored; unused or low-value logs are identified and potentially filtered out earlier.
Sample DQL for Unparsed Log Inspection
// Identify logs potentially needing better parsing rules
fetch logs
| filter logLevel == "NONE"
| summarize count(), earliest(timestamp), latest(timestamp) by log.source, dt.entity.host, dt.process.name
| sort count() desc

Final Tip
> Good logs aren't just for debugging. They are critical telemetry assets for AI-driven operations, security insight, compliance tracking, cost management, and understanding user journeys. Treat them with care throughout their lifecycle, ensuring content, structure, and severity are accurate and consistent.

## üß± Log Formatting & Structure

- ‚úÖ Logs follow a **consistent format** (JSON or documented patterns).
- ‚úÖ Each log line includes a **parseable timestamp** (ISO8601, RFC3339, or `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS`).
- ‚úÖ Multi-line logs (e.g., stack traces) are properly handled.
- ‚úÖ All logs include a **message field** summarizing the event.
- ‚úÖ Timestamps are **in UTC** for global consistency.
- ‚úÖ Logging levels are used appropriately to avoid noise in production.

---

## üö® Severity Classification (`logLevel`, `severity_text`, `severity_number`)

- ‚úÖ Standard levels used: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`.
- ‚úÖ OpenTelemetry fields supported:
  - `severity_text`: Human-readable log level (`INFO`, `ERROR`, etc.)
  - `severity_number`: Numerical range from 1‚Äì24
- ‚úÖ Severity ranges:
  - `TRACE`: 1‚Äì4
  - `DEBUG`: 5‚Äì8
  - `INFO`: 9‚Äì12
  - `WARN`: 13‚Äì16
  - `ERROR`: 17‚Äì20

---

## üîÑ How Dynatrace OpenPipeline Handles `severity_number` Better

| Feature                             | Benefit                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FIELDS_REMAP()`                    | Map `severity_number` to standard `logLevel` during ingestion.         |
| Fallback logic                      | Derive `logLevel` from number if `severity_text` is missing.           |
| Conditional routing                 | Route logs differently based on numeric severity.                      |
| Normalization at scale              | Enforce uniform log levels across mixed sources (OTel, Fluent Bit, etc.)|
| Traceability                        | Combine severity with `trace_id`, `span_id`, and service context.      |

### üõ†Ô∏è Example Mapping Rule:

```dql
FIELDS_REMAP(logLevel, {
  "^([1-4])$": "TRACE",
  "^([5-8])$": "DEBUG",
  "^([9-12])$": "INFO",
  "^([13-16])$": "WARN",
  "^([17-20])$": "ERROR",
  "^([21-24])$": "FATAL"
}, fallback="INFO")
```

---

## üß© Enrichment & Context

- ‚úÖ Include contextual IDs: `environment`, `team`, `region`, `k8s.pod.name`, `host.name`.
- ‚úÖ Include `service.name` explicitly.
- ‚úÖ Add metadata using `FIELDS_ADD`, `FIELDS_COPY`.
- ‚úÖ Mask sensitive data using `FIELDS_MASK`.
- ‚úÖ Add `trace_id` and `span_id` for trace correlation.

---

## üîç Testing & Validation

- ‚úÖ Test format changes in staging first.
- ‚úÖ Use the **Dynatrace Log Viewer** to inspect parsed fields.
- ‚úÖ Validate with DQL:
  ```dql
  fetch logs
  | filter logLevel == "ERROR"
  | summarize count() by service.name
  ```

---

## üîÅ Dynatrace OpenPipeline Processing

- ‚úÖ Ensure logs pass through all stages:
  - **Parse** ‚Üí **Enrich** ‚Üí **Transform** ‚Üí **Mask** ‚Üí **Route**
- ‚úÖ Use `FIELDS_REMAP`, `FIELDS_RENAME`, `FIELDS_ADD`, and `FIELDS_MASK` strategically.
- ‚úÖ Routing rules associate logs with proper services/entities.
- ‚úÖ Validate OpenPipeline rules using test log samples.

---

## üìä Querying & Dashboarding

- ‚úÖ Fields like `logLevel`, `service.name`, `env` are visible in DQL.
- ‚úÖ Dashboards can break down logs by severity and source.
- ‚úÖ Problem cards use logs effectively when severity is parsed.
- ‚úÖ DQL sample:
  ```dql
  fetch logs
  | summarize count() by logLevel, service.name
  ```

---

## üß† Davis AI & Problem Detection

- ‚úÖ Davis can use logs with `logLevel` to identify or enrich issues.
- ‚úÖ Proper severity detection improves root cause analysis.
- ‚úÖ Logs correlate with traces and metrics on the same dashboard.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Governance & Maintenance

- ‚úÖ Standards are documented and visible to developers.
- ‚úÖ Rules are versioned and reviewed quarterly.
- ‚úÖ `logLevel: NONE` rate is monitored and reduced.
- ‚úÖ Ingestion volume and noise are regularly evaluated.

---

## üß™ DQL for Unparsed Logs

```dql
fetch logs
| filter logLevel == "NONE"
| summarize count(), earliest(timestamp), latest(timestamp) by log.source, dt.entity.host, dt.process.name
| sort count() desc
```

# üìò Log Format Types & Parsing Examples for Dynatrace OpenPipeline

This guide compares common log formats and provides examples of how to parse them using Dynatrace OpenPipeline's `PARSE()` function or preprocessing tools.

---

## 1. üü¢ JSON Format (Recommended)

### Example Log:
```json
{ "timestamp": "2024-04-08T12:00:00Z", "logLevel": "INFO", "message": "Service started", "service": "auth-service" }
```

### Parsing:
Dynatrace auto-detects JSON and extracts fields. No custom parsing usually needed.

---

## 2. üîµ Key-Value Format

### Example Log:
```
timestamp=2024-04-08 level=ERROR msg="Failed login" user=abc123
```

### Parsing Rule:
```dql
PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp level:logLevel msg:content user")
```

---

## 3. üü° Line-Based Log (Simple Pattern)

### Example Log:
```
2024-04-08 12:00:00 ERROR [auth-service] Failed login attempt
```

### Parsing Rule:
```dql
PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp logLevel:logLevel [service] content")
```

---

## 4. üü£ Apache/Nginx Access Logs

### Example Log:
```
127.0.0.1 - - [08/Apr/2024:12:00:00 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1024
```

### Parsing Rule:
```dql
PARSE(content, "ip - - [timestamp] \\"method url protocol\\" status bytes")
```

---

## 5. üß° Syslog

### Example Log:
```
<34>1 2024-04-08T12:00:00Z hostname appname 1234 - - Login failed
```

### Parsing Rule:
```dql
PARSE(content, "<priority>version timestamp host app pid - - content")
```

---

## 6. üî∂ Delimited Format (CSV)

### Example Log:
```
2024-04-08, ERROR, Failed login, auth-service
```

### Parsing Rule:
```dql
PARSECSV(content, ["timestamp", "logLevel", "content", "service"])
```

---

## 7. üî¥ Log4j Pattern Layout

### Log Pattern:
```
%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5p [%c] - %m%n
```

### Example Log:
```
2024-04-08 12:00:00 ERROR [auth-service] - Login failed
```

### Parsing Rule:
```dql
PARSE(content, "timestamp:timestamp logLevel:logLevel [service] - content")
```

---

## 8. ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiline Logs (e.g., Java stack traces)

- Must be merged **before ingestion** using tools like Fluent Bit or Cribl.
- Each stack trace should be captured as one log event.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendation

| Format    | Recommended | Why                          |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| JSON      | ‚úÖ Best      | Fully structured, rich fields |
| Key-Value | ‚úÖ Good      | Simple and clean              |
| Line/Text | ‚ö†Ô∏è Okay      | Requires custom rules         |
| Multiline | ‚ùå Avoid     | Needs merging logic           |
