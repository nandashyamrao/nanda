# Stages Prior to Querying in Dynatrace

Before you start **querying** using **Dynatrace Query Language (DQL)**, several foundational stages occur. These stages ensure that the necessary data is collected, organized, and contextualized for effective querying:

---

## **1. Setup and Instrumentation**
   - **Goal:** Enable monitoring by integrating Dynatrace into your environment.
   - **Key Actions:**
     - Install the **OneAgent** on hosts, services, and processes.
     - Configure **Cloud Integrations** (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
     - Enable **synthetic monitoring** for user interaction simulation.
   - **Outcome:** Dynatrace begins monitoring the environment and collecting raw data.
   - **Example:**
     - Installing OneAgent on EC2 instances to monitor host performance.

---

## **2. Discovery**
   - **Goal:** Automatically identify and map the components of your IT environment.
   - **Key Actions:**
     - Dynatrace discovers entities like hosts, services, processes, and databases.
     - Semantic models are created to map relationships (e.g., "Service A calls Database B").
   - **Outcome:** The topology of your environment is defined and visualized (e.g., in Smartscape).
   - **Example:**
     - Identifying all running services on a Kubernetes cluster.

---

## **3. Data Collection**
   - **Goal:** Gather detailed data points tied to discovered entities.
   - **Types of Data Collected:**
     1. **Metrics:** CPU usage, memory utilization, response time, etc.
     2. **Logs:** Application logs, system logs, and cloud logs.
     3. **Traces:** Distributed transaction flows across services.
     4. **Events:** Notifications of anomalies, deployments, or scaling activities.
   - **Outcome:** A rich set of data becomes available for analysis and monitoring.
   - **Example:**
     - Collecting CPU usage metrics for all EC2 instances in a specific region.

---

## **4. Semantics and Relationships**
   - **Goal:** Map relationships and dependencies between entities.
   - **Key Actions:**
     - Define how entities interact (e.g., "Service X depends on Database Y").
     - Establish relationships like **calls**, **contains**, and **depends_on**.
   - **Outcome:** Dependencies are visualized and ready for analysis.
   - **Example:**
     - Mapping a service's API calls to an upstream database.

---

## **5. Real-Time Monitoring and Baseline Creation**
   - **Goal:** Continuously monitor entities and establish performance baselines.
   - **Key Actions:**
     - Monitor metrics, logs, and traces in real-time.
     - Establish baselines for normal behavior (e.g., average response time).
   - **Outcome:** Any deviations from baselines (anomalies) can be flagged for further analysis.
   - **Example:**
     - Setting a baseline for database response time to detect future anomalies.

---

## **6. Alerts and AI Insights**
   - **Goal:** Automatically detect and alert on anomalies or problems.
   - **Key Actions:**
     - Use Davis AI to correlate anomalies and generate problem tickets.
     - Configure alert thresholds for specific metrics or events.
   - **Outcome:** Problems are automatically detected, reducing the need for manual monitoring.
   - **Example:**
     - Alerting when response time exceeds 200ms for a critical service.

---

## **7. Visualization and Context Building**
   - **Goal:** Provide a unified view of the environment through visualizations.
   - **Key Actions:**
     - Use Smartscape to visualize dependencies.
     - Build dashboards to monitor KPIs (e.g., error rates, request throughput).
   - **Outcome:** Data is organized and contextualized for easier analysis.
   - **Example:**
     - A dashboard showing CPU usage for all production hosts.

## **How These Stages Enable Querying**
Each of these stages lays the groundwork for effective querying:
- **Setup and Discovery:** Ensures entities and relationships are recognized.
- **Data Collection:** Ensures thereâ€™s data to query (metrics, logs, traces, events).
- **Semantics and Monitoring:** Adds context and baseline data for meaningful insights.
- **Visualization and Alerts:** Helps identify focus areas for queries.
