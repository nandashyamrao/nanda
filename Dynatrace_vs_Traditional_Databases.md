# Dynatrace: A New Perspective on Data Organization Compared to Traditional Databases

Dynatrace’s backend, powered by its **Grail** lakehouse architecture, introduces unique paradigms for data organization, querying, and visualization that differ significantly from traditional database systems. Here are the key distinctions and the new perspectives required to understand Dynatrace’s data model:

---

## **1. Entities and Relationships Instead of Tables**
- **Traditional Databases**: Focus on structured tables and rows (e.g., relational models like SQL).
- **Dynatrace**: Data revolves around **entities** (hosts, services, applications, etc.) and their **relationships**.
  - **New Perspective**: Visualize data as a **graph or topology** where entities are nodes, and relationships like `calls`, `contains`, and `depends_on` form the edges.

---

## **2. Time-Series Data as a Core Focus**
- **Traditional Databases**: Primarily handle transactional data without inherent focus on time-series data.
- **Dynatrace**: Optimized for **time-series data**, where every metric or log has a timestamp.
  - **New Perspective**: Think in terms of trends, baselines, and historical comparisons rather than static records.

---

## **3. Unified Data Model**
- **Traditional Databases**: Store logs, metrics, and events in separate systems (e.g., log files, monitoring databases, and alert systems).
- **Dynatrace**: Integrates **logs, metrics, events, and traces** into a unified data model.
  - **New Perspective**: Visualize all types of data converging around an entity. Logs, metrics, and traces are interconnected.

---

## **4. Schema-Less Storage for Logs**
- **Traditional Databases**: Require rigid schemas with predefined structures for storing data.
- **Dynatrace**: Log ingestion is **schema-less**, and logs are indexed dynamically for flexibility.
  - **New Perspective**: Logs do not need pre-designed schemas, but queries utilize indexed fields like `log.source.aws.s3.bucket.name`.

---

## **5. Smart Topologies via Smartscape**
- **Traditional Databases**: No inherent ability to visualize relationships or dependencies.
- **Dynatrace**: Dynamically generates a **Smartscape topology** that maps real-time relationships between entities.
  - **New Perspective**: Instead of abstracting dependencies via foreign keys, visualize live interconnections.

---

## **6. Event-Centric Monitoring**
- **Traditional Databases**: Handle events as secondary data (e.g., triggers or logs).
- **Dynatrace**: Events like state changes, anomalies, or deployments are first-class citizens tied to entities.
  - **New Perspective**: Treat events as actionable insights rather than just records to analyze post-failure.

---

## **7. Query Language Focused on Observability**
- **Traditional Databases**: Use SQL for querying static data sets.
- **Dynatrace**: Uses **Dynatrace Query Language (DQL)**, optimized for observability data like logs, metrics, and traces.
  - **New Perspective**: Query data types together (e.g., `fetch logs` combined with `fetch metrics`).

---

## **8. No Direct Joins Across Tables**
- **Traditional Databases**: Joins are used to query across tables.
- **Dynatrace**: Relies on **relationship mapping** (e.g., `calls`, `contains`) instead of explicit joins.
  - **New Perspective**: Explore relationships natively through the entity graph instead of designing complex join queries.

---

## **9. Baseline and Anomaly Detection**
- **Traditional Databases**: Require manual thresholds or external tools for anomaly detection.
- **Dynatrace**: Automatically calculates baselines and flags anomalies using **Davis AI**.
  - **New Perspective**: Data is constantly analyzed and contextualized rather than queried retrospectively.

---

## **10. Multi-Tiered Data Storage**
- **Traditional Databases**: Typically store all data in a single tier (e.g., relational tables).
- **Dynatrace**: Uses a **multi-tiered storage** strategy:
  - **High-Speed Cache**: Real-time data.
  - **Short-Term Storage**: Granular data for hours or days.
  - **Long-Term Storage**: Aggregated data for weeks or months.
  - **New Perspective**: Query data based on retention policies (e.g., “last 5 minutes” vs. “last 6 months”).

---

## **11. Focus on Actionable Insights**
- **Traditional Databases**: Provide raw data and rely on external tools for visualization.
- **Dynatrace**: Prioritizes actionable insights and decision-making (e.g., alerts, root cause analysis).
  - **New Perspective**: Data drives immediate remediation rather than retrospective analysis.

---

## **12. Data Security and Multi-Tenancy**
- **Traditional Databases**: Require external configuration for security and tenancy.
- **Dynatrace**: Built-in **RBAC** and multi-tenant architecture for isolating data securely.
  - **New Perspective**: Manage data at the tenant or team level without additional database layers.
