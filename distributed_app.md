## 🔍 **What Is the Distributed Tracing App?**

The **Distributed Tracing App** in Dynatrace provides visibility into how individual requests flow through your services, microservices, containers, databases, and 3rd-party dependencies. It is built on trace data ingested from:
- **OpenTelemetry**
- **Dynatrace OneAgent**

### 🚀 Key Goal:
To help you **analyze, troubleshoot, and optimize** performance across distributed systems — from frontend to backend — using trace and span data.

## 🧰 **Core Components**

| Concept        | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Trace**      | A full journey of a request through multiple services (frontend to DB).     |
| **Span**       | A single operation within that trace (e.g., DB query, HTTP call).           |
| **Request**    | A service call made by a client — consists of multiple spans.               |
| **Attributes** | Metadata attached to spans (like service name, cluster, duration, etc).     |
| **Histogram**  | Visual representation of latency distribution across requests.              |
