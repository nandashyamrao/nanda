# Core Goals of Dynatrace

Dynatrace is designed to provide comprehensive observability, automation, and analytics across your IT environment. Below are the **core goals** of Dynatrace, their descriptions, and key features.

---

## **1. Entity Association**
**Goal**: Tie all attributes, metrics, logs, traces, and metadata to entities.

- An **entity** represents a monitored component (e.g., host, service, application, cloud resource).
- **Why It Matters**:
  - Unified view of each component.
  - Enables deep analysis and troubleshooting.

---

## **2. End-to-End Observability**
**Goal**: Provide complete visibility across all layers of your IT ecosystem.

- **Components Monitored**:
  - Infrastructure (hosts, cloud resources).
  - Applications (services, databases, APIs).
  - End-user interactions (web/mobile sessions).
- **Outcome**:
  - Real-time monitoring of your full-stack environment.

---

## **3. Automated Dependency Mapping**
**Goal**: Automatically map relationships and dependencies between entities.

- **Features**:
  - Visualized as the **Smartscape topology**.
  - Tracks interactions like "Service A calls Service B" or "Host X runs Process Y."
- **Value**:
  - Quick identification of upstream/downstream impacts of an issue.

---

## **4. AI-Powered Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**
**Goal**: Use Davis AI for automated analysis of issues.

- **How It Works**:
  - Analyzes millions of events in real-time.
  - Pinpoints the root cause of an issue.
  - Suggests resolutions based on historical data.
- **Outcome**:
  - Speeds up incident resolution.
  - Reduces manual troubleshooting efforts.

---

## **5. Proactive Problem Detection**
**Goal**: Identify anomalies before they impact users.

- **What It Detects**:
  - Sudden metric spikes or drops.
  - Abnormal patterns in user behavior or traffic.
  - System health degradations (e.g., failing services).
- **Value**:
  - Proactive mitigation of issues.

---

## **6. Business Analytics**
**Goal**: Connect technical performance to business outcomes.

- **Key Features**:
  - Monitor user behavior and sessions.
  - Link performance metrics to revenue-impacting KPIs (e.g., cart abandonments).
  - Track custom business events (e.g., transaction counts).
- **Outcome**:
  - Insight into how technical performance affects customer experience and revenue.

---

## **7. Continuous Performance Baselines**
**Goal**: Automatically establish baselines for every entity and metric.

- **Example**: A service typically responds in 200 ms; deviations are flagged.
- **Why It Matters**:
  - Adaptive baselines enable anomaly detection even as environments evolve.

---

## **8. Unified Data Platform**
**Goal**: Combine metrics, logs, traces, and events into a single platform.

- **Benefits**:
  - No need for multiple tools.
  - Unified context for faster debugging and accurate analysis.

---

## **9. Extensibility via APIs**
**Goal**: Enable customization and integration through APIs.

- **Capabilities**:
  - Pull data (metrics, logs, traces) or push custom data.
  - Automate workflows (e.g., CI/CD pipelines).
  - Integrate with third-party tools (e.g., Splunk, Grafana).
- **Use Cases**:
  - Build custom dashboards.
  - Advanced reporting.
  - Automate incident management.

---

## **10. Scalability for Large Environments**
**Goal**: Handle monitoring for thousands of hosts and dynamic architectures.

- **Features**:
  - Efficient monitoring resource scaling.
  - Support for microservices, multi-cloud, and hybrid environments.

---

## **11. Ease of Deployment**
**Goal**: Simplify setup and configuration.

- **How It Works**:
  - **OneAgent**: Automatically discovers and instruments components on a host.
  - **ActiveGate**: Enables secure monitoring of on-prem and cloud environments.
