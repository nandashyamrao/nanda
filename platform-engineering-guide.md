## 1️⃣ Introduction to Platform Engineering
### **What is Platform Engineering?**
Platform Engineering focuses on **building internal developer platforms (IDPs)** that provide **self-service, automation, and standardization** for development and operations teams.

✅ **Goals of Platform Engineering**
- Reduce **developer friction** by automating infrastructure management.
- Standardize **CI/CD pipelines, observability, and security**.
- Implement **self-healing and cost optimization** in cloud environments.

## 2️⃣ Evolution of Software Delivery: From IT Ops to Platform Engineering
| Era | Key Characteristics | Challenges |
|-----|---------------------|------------|
| **Traditional IT Ops** | Manual provisioning, centralized teams | Slow, reactive, lacks automation |
| **DevOps** | CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) | Too many tools, no standardization |
| **SRE** | SLO-driven, observability | Still complex for developers |
| **Platform Engineering** | Self-service, automation | Solves DevOps & SRE bottlenecks |

---

## 3️⃣ Key Pain Points That Led to Platform Engineering
### **Why Was Platform Engineering Needed?**
🔴 **Developers struggled with Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm, and networking.**  
🔴 **No standard CI/CD pipelines, making deployments inconsistent.**  
🔴 **Security & compliance were often an afterthought.**  
🔴 **No automated rollback if deployments failed.**  
🔴 **Cloud costs skyrocketed without visibility.**

✅ **Platform Engineering solves these with self-service automation, golden paths, and AI-driven optimization.**

---

## 4️⃣ Workflow Comparison: Before vs. After Platform Engineering
### **How Software Delivery Worked Before Platform Engineering**
1️⃣ **Developers request infrastructure via ServiceNow tickets**  
2️⃣ **IT Ops manually provisions VMs, databases, and Kubernetes clusters**  
3️⃣ **Developers manually configure Kubernetes YAMLs and Helm charts**  
4️⃣ **Each team builds their own CI/CD pipeline in GitLab**  
5️⃣ **Security & compliance are checked manually before production**  
6️⃣ **If issues arise, on-call engineers manually investigate and fix**  
7️⃣ **Cloud costs increase unpredictably due to unoptimized workloads**

🔴 **Problems:**
❌ Slow infrastructure provisioning  
❌ No standardization across teams  
❌ Manual security enforcement  
❌ No automated rollback or self-healing  
❌ High cloud costs with no governance  

---

### **How Software Delivery Works with Platform Engineering**
1️⃣ **Developers self-provision Kubernetes clusters via a self-service portal (Backstage, Humanitec, AWS Service Catalog)**  
2️⃣ **GitLab CI/CD pipelines automatically deploy applications using standard Helm charts**  
3️⃣ **Dynatrace monitors reliability & security (Site Reliability Guardian enforces SLOs)**  
4️⃣ **Keptn automates canary deployments & rollbacks**  
5️⃣ **Dynatrace Workflows handle automated remediation (e.g., restarting failed pods)**  
6️⃣ **Cloud cost monitoring & auto-scaling optimizations prevent unnecessary expenses**  

✅ **Key Improvements:**
🚀 **Self-service removes ticket-based delays**  
🚀 **CI/CD is standardized with golden paths**  
🚀 **Security is built into the pipeline (Security as Code)**  
🚀 **Self-healing & rollback automation reduce downtime**  
🚀 **FinOps prevents excessive cloud spending**

## 5️⃣ Core Principles of Platform Engineering
| Principle | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| **Self-Service Developer Portals** | Allow developers to provision infrastructure without tickets. |
| **Golden Paths & Standardization** | Standard CI/CD pipelines for consistency. |
| **Automated Observability** | Unified logging, tracing, and monitoring (Dynatrace, OpenTelemetry). |
| **Security as Code** | Enforce security policies in CI/CD and Kubernetes workloads. |
| **Cost Optimization** | Use FinOps automation to control cloud spending. |

---

## 6️⃣ Platform Engineering Components & Tools
| Category | Tools |
|----------|------|
| **CI/CD & Automation** | GitLab CI/CD, ArgoCD, Terraform |
| **Observability & Reliability** | Dynatrace, OpenTelemetry |
| **Security & Compliance** | Dynatrace Security, HashiCorp Vault |
| **Incident Response** | Dynatrace Workflows, ServiceNow |
| **Cloud Cost Optimization** | Dynatrace Grail, AWS Cost Explorer |

---

## 7️⃣ Applying Platform Engineering to Kubernetes
🔴 **Before:** Developers manually configure Helm charts, secrets, and networking.  
✅ **After:** Platform Engineering automates Kubernetes workloads & observability.

🚀 **Example: GitLab Pipeline Deploying a Kubernetes App**
```yaml
deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
    - kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
```

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Final Thoughts & Next Steps
✅ **Platform Engineering enables self-service, automation, and cost-efficient cloud operations.**  
✅ **It reduces complexity for developers while improving security, observability, and cost controls.**  

🚀 **Next Steps:**
- Integrate GitLab, Dynatrace, and ServiceNow workflows for automation.
- Implement Site Reliability Guardian (SRG) to validate deployments.
- Automate security policies in Kubernetes with admission controllers.
