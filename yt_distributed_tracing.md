### Notes



### Introduction

In today's sophisticated digital environment, where applications are often comprised of numerous interconnected services, understanding performance issues and identifying failure points is paramount. The **Distributed Tracing Application** serves as a crucial tool for developers, platform engineers, and performance engineers. By allowing users to trace requests as they flow through different services, the application provides insights necessary for debugging and optimizing performance. Key concepts such as **spans**, **traces**, and **attributes** are fundamental to this tool's functionality, enabling users to analyze application behavior efficiently.

The significance of distributed tracing lies in its ability to reveal bottlenecks and traces of failures within microservices architectures. Developers can utilize frameworks such as **OpenTelemetry** and **OneAgent** to ingest their traces, creating opportunities to examine the health and performance of applications in real-time. 

### Overview of the Distributed Tracing App

Upon opening the **Distributed Tracing App**, users are greeted with an intuitive interface similar to various analytical applications. 

- **User Interface Features**: 
  - Top filters allow interaction with specific segments based on application workloads, Kubernetes clusters, and other attributes.
  - A time filter enables users to view data within a defined timeframe, such as the last 30 minutes or any desired duration.
  
These features empower users to customize their analysis according to their unique needs and focus on performance metrics such as response times and error rates.

### Performance Metrics and Analyzing Request Data

A vital part of using the Distributed Tracing App is understanding performance metrics that aid in identifying application behavior.

- **Time Series Overview**: 
  - A graphic insight into performance and load distribution across traces over the last 30 minutes reveals key data such as the **90th percentile** and average response times.
  - Users can explore successful and failed requests, enabling efficient identification of failure patterns.
  
- **Histogram Feature**: 
  - Switching to a histogram view allows users to visualize the distribution of requests based on response times.
  - Notably, the average response time can be highlighted, along with the 90th percentile indicating that 90% of requests are faster than a specific measure (e.g., 24 milliseconds). 

This functionality is critical to recognizing performance hotspots and addressing underlying issues that may cause failures, such as timeouts or service queue waits.

### Filtering and Interaction Capabilities

The application is designed with interactivity in mind, granting engineers the capability to perform detailed filtering and exploratory data analyses.

- **Interactive Filtering**:
  - Users can apply filters to isolate failed requests, allowing deeper examination of performance issues.
  - The ability to group data by services and endpoints facilitates an aggregated view of performance across various components.

For instance, if a particular service shows a 100% failure rate, engineers can identify which component is problematic. By simply clicking on a service or endpoint, users can retrieve crucial performance data metrics, including the failure rate and response times.

### Distributed Traces and Span Analysis

Understanding spans is critical in analyzing individual traces within the application.

- **Trace Structure**:
  - A trace is defined as a collection of spans linked through a unique trace ID, offering a visual representation of the request journey across services.
  - Each node in a trace represents a span — and while a span denotes an individual operation, the root node marks the request, contributing to overall trace architecture.

The application effectively enables users to drill down into each node to access individual attributes and logs. This feature is especially valuable for examining exceptions or long-running database queries.

### Analytics for Database Queries

A prominent use case is assessing database performance through spans dedicated to database operations.

- **Span Analytics**:
  - Users can filter spans specifically to display database calls, further facilitating insight into critical operations within services.
  - By reviewing database queries, developers can identify which execute most frequently or are particularly slow, yielding opportunities for optimization.

The result could involve discovering a common query being executed thousands of times across multiple services, pinpointing it as a potential area for performance improvement.

### Conclusion and Key Takeaways

The **Distributed Tracing Application** stands out as an essential tool for comprehending microservices behavior and improving application reliability. By taking advantage of features such as interactive filtering, histogram analysis, and span tracking, engineers are equipped to uncover underlying issues effectively. 

**Main Takeaways**:

The ability to set time filters enhances the app's versatility, allowing different time frames for analysis.

**Time Series Overview**:
The default view presents a time series overview that displays the performance metrics of traces over the last 30 minutes. Key performance indicators such as the 90th percentile, 50th percentile, average response times, and numbers of successful and failed requests are readily visible.

#### Switching Views
The app offers the ability to switch from a time series view to a histogram view, which is particularly useful in pinpointing performance hotspots. By representing data distribution based on response times visually, users can quickly identify trends and anomalies. 

For example, if the average response time is found to be 65 milliseconds, and the 90th percentile shows that 90% of requests are completed in 24 milliseconds, it becomes evident that the majority of slow responses are tied to failed requests. 

#### Response Time Filtering
Users can zoom in on specific sections of a chart to filter data further. By analyzing only the failed requests, one can delve deeper into those instances that do not conform to the expected performance metrics. This feature provides rich context on the nature of each failed request, including the HTTP status codes and the origins of the data (be it OpenTelemetry or OneAgent).

#### Grouping Metrics
Another powerful feature of the app involves the ability to group requests by service and endpoint. This offers a clear picture of which services or endpoints are contributing to failure rates. For instance, if the load generator service shows a 100% failure rate, it may indicate a critical issue that needs addressing.

### Filtering and Interaction Dynamics
Users can interact directly with the tables containing performance data, enabling actions such as sorting and further focusing on failed requests. By engaging with the user interface, they can refine their searches for specific criteria, enhancing their ability to diagnose issues.

#### Distributed Trace Navigation
The concept of distributed traces, which are collections of spans connected by a unique trace ID, comes into play. Users can click through the various spans of execution from the load generator to services and backends. This clear visual representation allows users to follow the flow of a request through multiple services, indicative of microservices architecture.

Each span provides attributes captured either through OpenTelemetry or OneAgent, displaying critical data, including execution times. This information is vital for performance engineers seeking to troubleshoot and optimize application performance.

### Detailed Analysis of Spans
After filtering for failed requests, users can shift their focus toward spans that showcase specific behaviors or exceptions occurring during execution. This is particularly beneficial for understanding where in the architecture database statements are executed and identifying performance bottlenecks.

Through the span analytics feature, users can filter down to spans that contain database queries, enabling high-level insights into database performance across services.
