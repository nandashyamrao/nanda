- **Key Features:**
  - Defines automated workflows for repetitive tasks like scaling services or restarting processes.
  - Integrates with CI/CD pipelines to monitor deployments in real time.
  - Automates anomaly detection and resolution using Davis AI.
- **Example:**
  - Automatically scaling up instances when traffic spikes or restarting a crashed process.
- **Use Case:**
  - Reduce manual intervention by automating routine tasks.
  - Enhance DevOps workflows with real-time feedback loops.
- **Analogy:**
  - **Self-Driving Car:** Like a car that automatically adjusts speed, lane, and direction based on traffic and road conditions.

## 15. Lifecycle Management Model
- **Purpose:** Tracks and manages the lifecycle of applications, services, and other entities from deployment to retirement.
- **Key Features:**
  - Monitors the performance and health of entities at each lifecycle stage.
  - Provides insights into how deployments or updates impact overall performance.
  - Tracks entity changes and ensures rollback capabilities.
- **Example:**
  - Monitoring the impact of a new deployment on service response times.
- **Use Case:**
  - Streamline DevOps workflows by providing lifecycle-specific insights.
  - Mitigate risks during application upgrades or retirements.
- **Analogy:**
  - **Project Milestone Tracker:** Like a project management tool that tracks tasks from inception to completion and flags delays or bottlenecks.

## 16. User Experience Model
- **Purpose:** Monitors and enhances the experience of end-users interacting with applications.
- **Key Features:**
  - Tracks user interactions, session durations, and navigation paths.
  - Identifies friction points like slow-loading pages or frequent app crashes.
  - Correlates user behavior with backend performance.
