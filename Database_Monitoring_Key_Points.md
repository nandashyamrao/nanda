# Key Points â€“ Database Monitoring Tutorial

This section highlights the essential takeaways from the video tutorial.

---

## 1. **Importance of Database Monitoring**
- Databases are the backbone of most applications.
- Monitoring helps identify performance bottlenecks early.
- Ensures better user experience and system stability.

---

## 2. **Types of Monitoring Covered**
- **CPU Monitoring**: Foreground vs Background usage
- **Memory Monitoring**: Focus on PGA (Program Global Area)
- **Query Performance**: Time taken by individual SQL queries
- **I/O Monitoring**: Physical reads/writes
- **Sessions and Locks**: Active, blocked sessions, and deadlocks

---

## 3. **Query Tuning**
- Long execution times add to latency.
- Repeated slow queries can consume CPU and memory.
- Optimization improves overall performance.

---

## 4. **CPU Usage Breakdown**
- **Foreground CPU**: Represents real-time app usage
- **Background CPU**: System processes like sync jobs
- High foreground usage can signal inefficient processes.

---

## 5. **PGA Memory**
- Session-specific memory allocation in Oracle DB.
- Crucial for query execution (sorting, hashing).
- Low PGA memory may cause slowdowns due to disk swapping.

---

## 6. **Database Load Analysis**
- DB Time = CPU Time + Wait Time
- Helps quantify system pressure and prioritize improvements.

---

## 7. **I/O and Physical Reads/Writes**
- Excessive I/O affects performance.
- Understanding I/O patterns helps optimize indexing and caching.

---

## 8. **Deadlocks and Blocking**
- Must monitor and eliminate deadlocks.
- Blocking sessions degrade user experience.

---

## 9. **Monitoring Tools**
- Use platforms like **AppDynamics** and **Dynatrace** for real-time insights.
- Helps correlate application and database metrics.

---

## 10. **Actionable Recommendations**
- Use monitoring data to inform developers and analysts.
- Fix issues before production deployments.
- Customize monitoring based on your application needs.
