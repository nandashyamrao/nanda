## **Detailed Explanation**

### **Library Section = Entity**
- Represents the **context** (e.g., services, hosts, applications) where data originates.
- Example: **Payment Service** as an entity links logs, metrics, events, and traces to the same service.

### **Catalog = Table**
- Organizes data **by type** (e.g., logs, metrics, events, spans).
- Example: The **Logs Table** contains all logs, while the **Metrics Table** stores time-series data like CPU or memory usage.

### **Shelf = Bucket**
- Physical storage for data with **retention policies**.
- Example: Logs might be stored in **default_logs** or a **payment_logs** bucket for better organization.

### **Book = Record**
- The smallest unit of data, representing a **log entry, metric point, event, or trace span**.
- Example: 
  - Log: `ERROR: Payment service timeout at 10:30 AM`.
  - Metric: `CPU Usage: 80% at 10:30 AM`.
  - Event: `Deployment started at 10:30 AM`.
  - Trace: `Database query took 500ms`.

### **Reading List = View**
- Predefined queries provide **curated insights** for specific use cases.
- Example:
  - Logs: "Show me all error logs from the Payment Service."
  - Metrics: "Show me CPU usage above 80% for the past hour."
  - Events: "Show me failed deployments in production."
  - Traces: "Show me traces with latency > 2 seconds."

### **Librarian’s Reports = Metadata**
- Tracks **system-level information** about tables, buckets, and events.
- Example:
  - Logs: `dt.system.buckets` shows all buckets storing log data.
  - Metrics: Metadata about available metrics (e.g., `CPU`, `Memory`).
  - Events: Metadata for system-generated events.
  - Traces: Metadata for span structure and trace identifiers.

### **Library Rules = Policies**
- Define **who can access what data**.
- Example:
  - Logs: Developers can view **all logs**, while security teams see only **audit logs**.
  - Metrics: Teams see metrics for their service only.
  - Events: Only admins see deployment-related events.
  - Traces: Trace access might be limited to specific environments.

### **Book Tagging = Pipelines**
- **Enrich and route data** during ingestion.
- Example:
  - Logs: Add a tag like `environment=production`.
  - Metrics: Include service-specific tags like `service=payment`.
  - Events: Attach severity levels (e.g., `critical` or `warning`).
  - Traces: Add trace IDs for cross-service correlation.

### **Book Retention = Retention**
- Defines how long data is stored.
- Example:
  - Logs: Retain for 35 days by default.
  - Metrics: Retain for 1 year for historical trend analysis.
  - Events: Retain for 90 days to comply with audit requirements.
  - Traces: Retain for 7 days due to high volume.

### **Library Alerts = Monitoring**
- Enables real-time notifications based on data queries.
- Example:
  - Logs: Alert if more than 100 errors occur in an hour.
  - Metrics: Alert if CPU usage exceeds 80% for 10 minutes.
  - Events: Alert on failed deployments in production.
  - Traces: Alert on traces with latency above a specific threshold.
