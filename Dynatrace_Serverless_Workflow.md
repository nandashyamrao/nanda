# Example Workflow: Monitoring Serverless Environments with AWS Lambda

## Step 1: **Data Ingestion**
- **What Happens:**
  - Dynatrace integrates with AWS CloudWatch to ingest logs, metrics, and events for your Lambda functions.
  - **Cloud Integration** detects Lambda functions and starts monitoring performance.
  - Data is ingested into **Grail**, with each record tagged by Lambda function name, region, and AWS account.

- **Example:**
  - AWS Lambda functions:
    - `OrderProcessorFunction` in `us-east-1`.
    - `NotificationServiceFunction` in `us-west-2`.

- **DQL Insight:**
  - Query all Lambda entities detected:
    ```dql
    fetch dt.entity.aws_lambda_function
    | fields entity.name, entity.region, entity.aws.account.id
    ```

---

## Step 2: **Storage and Indexing**
- **What Happens:**
  - Metrics such as invocation duration, error rates, and throttles are stored as time-series data in Grail.
  - Logs (e.g., application logs) are indexed by metadata like Lambda function name and execution ID.
  - Events such as errors or scaling activities are also recorded.

- **Example:**
  - Metrics stored for `OrderProcessorFunction`:
    - Invocation Duration: `builtin:aws.lambda.duration` → [Timestamp: 12:00, Value: 350ms]
    - Error Rate: `builtin:aws.lambda.errors` → [Timestamp: 12:00, Value: 5%]

- **DQL Insight:**
  - Query metrics for `OrderProcessorFunction`:
    ```dql
    fetch metrics
    | filter entity.name == "OrderProcessorFunction"
    | filter metric.key == "builtin:aws.lambda.duration"
    | fields timestamp, metric.value
    ```

---

## Step 3: **Real-Time Analysis**
- **What Happens:**
  - Davis AI analyzes metrics and logs to detect anomalies, such as:
    - Invocation durations exceeding baselines.
    - Spikes in error rates or throttles.
  - Correlations are drawn between function metrics, logs, and CloudWatch events.

- **Example:**
  - **Scenario**: `OrderProcessorFunction`’s invocation duration exceeds its baseline by 30%.
  - **Davis AI Insight**: Correlates this anomaly with an increase in event payload size.

- **DQL Insight:**
  - Detect anomalies in invocation duration:
    ```dql
    fetch metrics
    | filter metric.key == "builtin:aws.lambda.duration"
    | detect anomalies
    | fields timestamp, entity.name, anomaly_score
    ```

---

## Step 4: **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**
- **What Happens:**
  - Davis AI identifies the root cause:
    - Metrics indicate longer invocation durations.
    - Logs show that a database query in the Lambda function is timing out.
    - Event data highlights a recent deployment that changed query parameters.

- **Example:**
  - **RCA**: Slow database queries due to inefficient indexing after a deployment.

- **DQL Insight:**
  - Query logs for errors related to database queries:
    ```dql
    fetch logs
    | filter entity.name == "OrderProcessorFunction"
    | filter message contains "timeout"
    | fields timestamp, message
    ```

---

## Step 5: **Visualization**
- **What Happens:**
  - The Smartscape view highlights the **Lambda-to-Database** dependency, with the database flagged as the bottleneck.
  - Dashboards visualize:
    - Invocation duration trends.
    - Error rates over time.
    - Dependency flows.

- **Example:**
  - **Smartscape Visualization**:
    - `OrderProcessorFunction` → **Calls** → `Database X`
    - Database X is highlighted as a performance bottleneck.

---

## Step 6: **Proactive Alerts and Insights**
- **What Happens:**
  - Davis AI sends a detailed alert:
    - **Message**: "Invocation duration of `OrderProcessorFunction` exceeds baseline by 30%. Root cause: slow queries on Database X."
  - Suggested resolution:
    - "Optimize database query parameters or consider scaling Database X."

- **DQL Insight:**
  - Query events for anomalies:
    ```dql
    fetch events
    | filter entity.name == "OrderProcessorFunction"
    | filter event.type == "ANOMALY"
    | fields timestamp, event.title, event.cause
    ```

---

## Step 7: **Automation and Resolution**
- **What Happens:**
  - Automation workflows are triggered, such as:
    - Scaling the database to handle higher workloads.
    - Rolling back to a previous deployment version if needed.

- **Example:**
  - **Resolution**: Database X scales from 2 to 4 instances to reduce query latency.

---

## Step 8: **Post-Incident Reporting**
- **What Happens:**
  - A report is generated summarizing:
    - The anomaly detected.
    - Root cause identified.
    - Resolution steps taken.
  - This report can be shared with stakeholders via Dynatrace dashboards or external tools.

- **DQL Insight:**
  - Generate a post-incident summary:
    ```dql
    fetch events
    | filter entity.name == "OrderProcessorFunction"
    | summarize by event.type, count()
    ```
