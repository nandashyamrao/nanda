# Dynatrace Data Types and Outputs: Grouped and Expanded

## Raw Data Types
These are the fundamental data types collected by Dynatrace for monitoring and analysis.

- **Metrics**: Numeric, time-series data representing performance or resource utilization.
- **Logs**: Textual event data from applications, systems, and cloud environments.
- **Traces**: End-to-end request flows in distributed systems.
- **Events**: Notifications of state changes, anomalies, or predefined triggers.
- **Relationships**: Links between entities such as `calls`, `contains`, or `depends_on`.
- **Metadata**: Descriptive information about entities like hostnames, OS types, or runtime versions.
- **Code-Level Data**: Includes method timings, code execution paths, and variable values.
- **User Session Details**: Data like user actions, browser information, geographic location.
- **Security Data**: Vulnerabilities, attack patterns, and user access information.

## Derived Data Types
These are insights generated from raw data, often used for anomaly detection, performance benchmarking, or tailored monitoring.

- **Baselines**: Automatically established performance norms for metrics, services, or entities.
- **Alerts**: Notifications triggered by thresholds or anomalies (e.g., high CPU usage alerts).
- **Custom Events**: User-defined occurrences like deployments, sales spikes, or manual changes.
- **Business Data**: Metrics mapping technical performance to business outcomes (e.g., revenue, conversion rates).
- **Synthetic Monitoring Results**: Data from tests simulating user interactions, such as uptime or API performance.
- **Anomaly Detection Results**: Scores and classifications generated by Dynatrace's anomaly detection engine.
- **Forecasting**: Predictions for metrics, helping to anticipate future performance and capacity needs.
- **AI-Generated Insights**: Recommendations provided by Davis AI, such as root cause analysis, problem explanations, and optimization suggestions.

## Data Outputs and Visualizations
These represent structured views or visualizations derived from raw and processed data for monitoring and reporting.

- **Dashboards**: Visual representations of metrics, logs, traces, and events tailored for specific use cases.
- **Reports**: Scheduled or on-demand exports summarizing aggregated data (e.g., weekly performance reports).
- **Topology Maps**: Real-time visualizations of entity relationships, such as Dynatraceâ€™s Smartscape.
- **Session Replay**: Visual recordings of user interactions for UX and performance analysis, capturing mouse movements, clicks, and page load timings.
- **PurePaths**: Visualizations of individual transaction traces, showing the flow of requests through your application.
- **Service Flow**: Shows how requests flow between different services in your application.

## Access Layers
These provide programmatic or configuration-based access to Dynatrace data.

- **API Responses**: Dynamic outputs from Dynatrace APIs, such as `/metrics` or `/entities` queries.
- **Configuration Data**: Details about entity setups like enabled plugins or cloud integration settings.
- **Tags and Attributes**: Labels and key-value pairs for grouping, filtering, and categorizing entities.
- **Dynatrace Query Language (DQL)**: Enables detailed querying of Dynatrace data for custom insights.
- **Webhooks**: Sends data to external systems, enabling integrations or triggering actions.
