# How Dynatrace Organizes Data in the Backend

Dynatrace organizes data in the backend using a purpose-built architecture designed for scalability, real-time processing, and accessibility. Here’s an explanation of how Dynatrace organizes data in its backend:

---

## 1. Unified Data Model

Dynatrace uses a **Unified Entity Model** to organize and associate all data types (metrics, logs, traces, events, and metadata). Every monitored component, known as an **entity**, becomes the central node that ties everything together.

### Key Features:
- **Entities**: Represent components like hosts, services, processes, and applications.
- **Attributes/Metadata**: Descriptive information tied to entities (e.g., OS type for a host, runtime version for a service).
- **Relationships**: Dependencies between entities (e.g., service-to-database calls).
- **Unique Identifiers**: Each entity has a unique ID (`dt.entity.<type>`), ensuring consistent access.

---

## 2. Time-Series Database (TSDB) for Metrics

Dynatrace stores metrics in a high-performance **time-series database** optimized for querying historical and real-time data.

- **Structure**:
  - Each metric is stored as a key-value pair with a timestamp.
  - Example: `builtin:host.cpu.usage → [Timestamp: 12:00, Value: 85%]`.
- **Efficient Compression**:
  - Uses delta and trend-based compression to reduce storage overhead.
- **Retention Policies**:
  - Aggregates old data (e.g., hourly or daily averages) to balance detail and storage.

---

## 3. Log Storage and Indexing

Logs are ingested, processed, and indexed in real time to enable quick search and analysis.

- **Storage**:
  - Logs are stored in raw format for auditing and deep dives.
- **Indexing**:
  - Indexed based on keywords, timestamps, and associated entities.
  - Example: A log entry for a service error is indexed under the `dt.entity.service` and error type.

---

## 4. Event Stream for Changes

Dynatrace tracks all **state changes and anomalies** as **events**.

- **Event Types**:
  - Deployment events.
  - Anomalies (e.g., response time spikes).
  - Health state changes (e.g., host goes offline).
- **Storage**:
  - Stored with metadata and associated entities.
  - Enables historical replay and dependency analysis.

---

## 5. Distributed Tracing Data

Distributed tracing involves tracking request flows across multiple services and processes.

- **Data Storage**:
  - Traces are stored as structured data, linking spans to parent traces.
- **Span-Level Metadata**:
  - Each trace includes details like:
    - **Start time**, **duration**, **error status**.
    - Relationships to upstream/downstream entities.
  - Example: A trace might show a **Service A** request calling **Service B**, which queries a **database**.

---

## 6. Relationship Mapping with Smartscape

Dynatrace builds a **Smartscape topology** to map relationships between entities.

- **Dynamic Topology**:
  - Captures how services, processes, and hosts interact.
  - Updates in real time as new entities are discovered or configurations change.
- **Usage**:
  - Supports root cause analysis by showing dependencies (e.g., “Service A depends on Database X”).

---

## 7. Storage Tiers

Dynatrace employs a **multi-tiered storage strategy** to balance performance, cost, and accessibility.

1. **Real-Time Data**:
   - Metrics, logs, and traces for the past few minutes are stored in high-speed memory caches.
2. **Short-Term Data**:
   - Detailed time-series data is stored in the primary time-series database for rapid querying.
   - Retention: Hours to days.
3. **Long-Term Data**:
   - Aggregated data (e.g., daily averages) is archived for historical analysis.
   - Retention: Weeks to years.

---

## 8. Davis AI Layer

Dynatrace’s **Davis AI** processes all ingested data to detect anomalies, correlate events, and provide insights.

- **AI Processing**:
  - Considers relationships, baselines, and trends.
  - Analyzes logs, metrics, and traces holistically.
- **Outcome**:
  - Alerts with root cause explanations.
  - Predictive insights based on historical patterns.

---

## 9. Data Accessibility via APIs

Dynatrace provides **extensive APIs** to access data efficiently.

- **Metrics API**:
  - Pull detailed metrics with filters (e.g., `cpu.usage` for specific hosts).
- **Logs API**:
  - Search and retrieve logs programmatically.
- **Entity API**:
  - Retrieve metadata, tags, and relationships for any entity.
- **Custom Data Ingestion**:
  - Push custom logs, metrics, and events for monitoring.

---

## 10. Security and Scalability

Dynatrace ensures data integrity and accessibility by implementing:

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Limits who can access specific data types or entities.
2. **Multi-Tenant Architecture**:
   - Separates data for different teams or environments.
3. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Dynamically scales storage and processing nodes to handle spikes in data volume.

---

## Example Flow: Host Data

1. **Host Discovery**:
   - OneAgent detects a new host and sends metadata (e.g., name, IP, OS).
2. **Metrics**:
   - Metrics like CPU and memory usage are stored in the TSDB.
3. **Logs**:
   - Logs from the host are indexed and associated with the host entity.
4. **Events**:
   - A health state change is recorded if the host goes offline.
5. **Relationships**:
   - The host is linked to the processes and services it supports.
6. **Access**:
   - Data is queried using the Dynatrace UI or APIs.

## Conclusion

Dynatrace organizes data in the backend to ensure:
- Real-time availability of metrics, logs, events, and traces.
- Seamless correlation of data to entities and relationships.
- Efficient querying and visualization for proactive monitoring and troubleshooting.
