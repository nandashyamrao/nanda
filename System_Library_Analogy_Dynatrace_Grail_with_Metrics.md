- **Catalogs** (Tables: Organize Data by Type)
  - History Catalog (Logs Table)
  - Science Catalog (Events Table)
  - Fiction Catalog (Spans Table)
  - Statistics Catalog (Metrics Series)

- **Shelves** (Buckets: Physical Storage for Data)
  - General History Shelf (Default Logs Bucket)
  - Specialized Payment Shelf (Payment Logs Bucket)
  - Rare Books Shelf (Audit Logs Bucket)

  - Statistical Chart (Metric Series)

- **Library Rules** (Policies: Control Access)
  - Staff-Only Access (Entity-Level Policies)
  - Restricted Rare Books (Bucket-Level Policies)
  - Public Books (Record-Level Policies)
  - Metrics-Only Access (Metric-Level Policies)

- **Librarian's Records** (Metadata: System-Level Information)

|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Entities                     | Library Sections             | Contextual groupings like services or applications (e.g., Payment Service).     |
| Tables                       | Catalogs                    | Organize data into logical types (e.g., logs, events, spans, metrics).          |
| Buckets                      | Shelves                     | Physical storage for data with retention policies (e.g., default_logs).         |
| Records                      | Books                       | Actual data points stored in buckets (e.g., log entries, spans, events, metrics).|
| Policies                     | Library Rules               | Define access control and governance (e.g., staff-only sections).               |
| Metadata                     | Librarian's Records         | System information like available shelves, catalogs, and event logs.            |
| Pipelines                    | Tagging and Organization    | Enrich and route incoming data to correct locations (e.g., add tags).           |
| Monitoring and Alerts        | Alerts and Notifications    | Real-time insights and alerts for unusual activities (e.g., overdue books).     |
