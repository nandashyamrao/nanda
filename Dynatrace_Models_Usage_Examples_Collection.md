# Comprehensive Examples of Dynatrace Unified Data Model

This document contains detailed examples of how Dynatrace models entities, attributes, and relationships across various real-world scenarios and technologies, including Kubernetes, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and more.

## Example 1: Kubernetes Cluster Monitoring

### Scenario:
Monitoring a Kubernetes cluster to optimize performance and identify service bottlenecks.

### Data Model Breakdown:
| **Data Element**  | **Kubernetes Example**                             | **Dynatrace Example**                                        |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Entities**      | Nodes, pods, and services in the cluster.          | Kubernetes nodes, container groups, and Kubernetes services.|
| **Attributes**    | Node role, pod labels, service annotations.        | Metadata like `role:worker`, `service.tag:backend`.         |
| **Metadata**      | Cluster configurations, namespace details.         | Cluster name, namespace, or orchestration tags.             |
| **Metrics**       | CPU and memory usage per pod, service response time.| Built-in metrics like `kubernetes.pod.cpu.usage`.           |
| **Logs**          | Pod logs for application errors or crashes.        | Real-time logs from containerized workloads.                |
| **Traces**        | Inter-service communication (e.g., service-to-service calls).| Distributed traces of requests within the cluster.          |
| **Relationships** | Dependency of services on pods and nodes.          | Links like `service.calls -> database`.                     |

### Workflow:
1. **Physical Model**:
   - Entities: Nodes (worker/master), Pods, Services.
   - Metrics: Monitor resource utilization like CPU/memory.

2. **Logical Model**:
   - Attributes: Group services by namespaces like `team:frontend` or `env:production`.
   - Metadata: Use annotations for configuration (e.g., service annotations).

3. **Semantic Model**:
   - Relationships: Map dependencies between services, such as "frontend service -> backend service -> database".
   - Traces: Track the flow of requests across multiple microservices.

### Problem:
The frontend service exhibits higher response times during peak hours.

### Resolution:
- Use traces to pinpoint which backend service contributes to delays.
- Analyze pod logs for errors or resource constraints.
- Scale up the affected service's pod count to handle peak traffic.

## Example 2: AWS Lambda with API Gateway

### Scenario:
Troubleshooting a high latency issue in an API Gateway-Lambda setup.

### Data Model Breakdown:
| **Data Element**  | **AWS Lambda Example**                              | **Dynatrace Example**                                        |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Entities**      | Lambda functions, API Gateway, DynamoDB.           | AWS Lambda function, API Gateway, database services.        |
| **Attributes**    | Function memory size, timeout, API Gateway stage.  | Metadata like `lambda.tag:function-type:compute`.           |
| **Metadata**      | Lambda runtime, IAM roles, endpoint configurations.| Runtime version, security roles, API Gateway configs.       |
| **Metrics**       | Invocation count, duration, error rates.           | Built-in metrics like `aws.lambda.invocations`.             |
| **Logs**          | Function logs, API Gateway access logs.            | Application logs tied to Lambda and Gateway.                |
| **Traces**        | Execution paths from API Gateway to Lambda and database.| Distributed traces of HTTP requests.                        |
| **Relationships** | API Gateway invokes Lambda, which queries DynamoDB.| Dependency map: `gateway.calls -> lambda -> database`.       |

### Workflow:
1. **Physical Model**:
   - Entities: Lambda functions, Gateway endpoints, DynamoDB tables.
   - Metrics: Measure execution time and error rates of Lambda functions.

2. **Logical Model**:
   - Attributes: Group functions by stages (e.g., `env:prod`, `team:backend`).
   - Metadata: Use IAM roles and runtime configurations for insights.

3. **Semantic Model**:
   - Relationships: Map how API Gateway triggers Lambda and how it queries DynamoDB.
   - Traces: Trace an API request through all stages (Gateway -> Lambda -> DynamoDB).

### Problem:
API Gateway responses are taking over 3 seconds.

### Resolution:
- Analyze traces to identify slow queries in DynamoDB.
- Review logs for timeout errors in the Lambda function.
- Optimize Lambda function memory or execution logic.

## Example 3: Smart Home Devices

### Scenario:
Optimizing energy consumption in a smart home.

### Data Model Breakdown:
| **Data Element**  | **Smart Home Example**                              | **Dynatrace Example**                                        |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Entities**      | Thermostats, smart lights, security cameras.       | Hosts, devices, processes.                                  |
| **Attributes**    | Device location, schedule, operating mode.         | Tags like `room:living_room`, `device.type:camera`.         |
| **Metadata**      | Device configurations like brightness, temperature.| Configuration details like runtime version.                 |
| **Metrics**       | Real-time power consumption data.                  | Metrics like `device.power.usage`.                          |
| **Logs**          | Device activity logs: "Light turned on at 8 PM".   | Logs capturing device events.                               |
| **Traces**        | "Motion detected -> light on -> camera records".   | Distributed traces showing workflows.                       |
| **Relationships** | Lights depend on motion sensors, cameras depend on light triggers.| Dependency graphs.                                          |

### Workflow:
1. **Physical Model**:
   - Entities: Devices (thermostats, cameras, lights).
   - Metrics: Monitor power usage and temperature.

2. **Logical Model**:
   - Attributes: Group devices by room or usage type (e.g., lighting, security).
   - Metadata: Configuration details like schedules.

3. **Semantic Model**:
   - Relationships: Map workflows such as "motion sensor triggers light".
   - Traces: Track multi-step workflows.

### Problem:
Energy consumption spikes when no one is home.

### Resolution:
- Use logs to identify devices running unnecessarily.
- Analyze relationships and schedules to adjust triggers.
- Implement automation to power down unused devices.

| **Logs**          | Transaction logs or payment errors.                | Logs showing user activity or server errors.               |
| **Traces**        | User journeys (browse -> add to cart -> checkout). | Distributed traces across services.                        |
| **Relationships** | Checkout depends on inventory and payment APIs.    | Dependency map: `frontend.calls -> payment.gateway`.        |

### Workflow:
