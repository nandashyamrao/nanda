# **Enhanced Dynatrace Workflow with Data Classifications**

This expanded workflow integrates the classification of data types, such as metadata, tags, attributes, metrics, logs, traces, events, and relationships, into the Dynatrace workflow.

## **Breakdown with Examples**

### **1. Discovery: Find Components**
- **Metadata**: Foundational details like `host.name`, `host.os`, `host.ip`.
- **Tags**: Auto-assigned tags like `region: us-east` or `cloud.provider: AWS`.
- **Relationships**: Host → Process, Host → Service.

---

### **2. Data Collection**
